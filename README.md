# Data Wild West - Project Structure

This repository contains all the necessary code and resources to reproduce the Data Wild West group project. 

Below is an overview of the key components and their organization:

### Code
Located in the "code" folder:

    1) Project_Notebook.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook where all the analyses are performed.
    2) libraries/utils.py: This file, located in the libraries subfolder, 
    contains all the functions utilized in Project_Notebook.ipynb.

### Data
Located in the "data" folder:

    1) This directory houses both the raw and processed data utilized in the project.

### Additional Folders
    1) "images": Contains images used in the report.
    2) "translations": This folder includes any translation files related to the project.
    3) "visualizations": Here, you will find visual representations and output generated during the project.
    4) "annotations": Contains annotations results, samples and the guideline.

Each folder is structured to provide a clear and organized workflow, ensuring easy navigation and replication of the project's results.



### Important what README.MD should contain

README.MD with description of the data, what all the files do - should be usable for another KDS or CS student

Project hand-in:

    1) Data & code
    1) Github
    2) E.g. large files can be external, e.g. OSF (5 GB free)
    - original/raw data
    - processed data
    - code/scripts you used for processing, analysis
    - should reproduce the tables/figures in your report
    - with comments, consistent variable naming, etc.
