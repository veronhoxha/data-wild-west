There was a steam room. It was closed in early 2022, supposedly due to high energy prices at the time. Never reopened. No reason given, other then the ridiculous argument that somehow, by keeping it open, the whole business would fail and the gym would then have to close down.

------
Pretty decent gym, still missing some basic equipment here and there, but overal it‚Äôs a quite okay gym. Some problems I have with this facility:

- Only having one leg extension machine
- No proper pull-up bars with the possibility to do different grips
- Overall, too small free weight section that 9/10 times reeks of testosterone. Literally. It stinks.
- Don‚Äôt bother going on weekdays between 16:30/19:00, then your workout will last more than twice as long because of the amount of waiting on equipment and machines.
- The music in the downstairs area is way too loud most of the times. If there was a boxing class going on, fair enough, but that‚Äôs usually not the case.
- Classes that take place (and they do a lot) on the rubber matting downstairs take up a lot of space, time and equipment. I make the effort avoiding going to the gym around those times because there won‚Äôt be any equipment left to use.

Good things:
- Loads of space compared to other gyms
- Has equipment that regular (cheaper) gyms don‚Äôt have > think more CrossFit minded gym set-up
- Enough squat racks (on quiet moments of the day)
- Eleiko weight plates, we like that
- Both mens and womens barbells
- Centrally located
- People training here are more professionally minded, keep to themselves and don‚Äôt bother others > the mindset and vibe in this gym is very pleasant.

But other than that it has everything you need and it‚Äôs okay priced when you‚Äôre a student just visiting this facility. Otherwise, I would probably find a different gym.",344f1158-Bogdan.csv,0.0,1.0,,,-1.0,update: i a,Bogdan,SATS gym in Copenhagen,1.0,update:,179.0

I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously.",0fe50f89-Veron.csv,-1.0,,,-1.0,,an unhygien,Veron,PureGym Copenhagen,1.0,an unhy,51.0

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use.

Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

It's one of the most expensive fitness world's centers in whole Denmark, but it's one of the most under equipped ones. You can find more equipment in lots of other cheaper centers and also the devices in this center already present in this one, either have less features or unadjusted, such as the treadmills, the scale and the rowing machines.",0fe50f89-Veron.csv,0.0,-1.0,1.0,,,very friend,Veron,PureGym Aalborg,3.0,very fr,320.0
505,542,"Very expensive place considering that the sauna and steam bath never work properly. If the sauna is not down, then the steambath is down, and it takes months for them to fix. The steambath has currently been down for 2-3 months, and before the steambath broke down, the sauna was down for an equally long time. Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while. The bench is bent and unstable, and the walls of the sauna are getting ripped apart. And noone gives a damn.

This fitness chain took down fitnessdk and turned it into utter garbage.",0fe50f89-Veron.csv,-1.0,,,-1.0,,very expens,Veron,PureGym Aarhus,1.0,very ex,336.0

So it is definitely worth driving to this other Fitness World with lots of evening classes and friendly staff.

The only thing is that in summer it can get very hot inside and the air is thick. So the ventilation can't keep up with the amount of people training.",0fe50f89-Veron.csv,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,i really en,Veron,PureGym Aarhus,4.0,i reall,340.0

The recent refurb has given a well deserved refresh to the place. Staff were very attentive when we were coming out of the covid restrictions. They seem to have fallen back into old patterns since. But are generally friendly and are there to help out.
