I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously.",05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 11:59PM

I asked the staff to fix it one week ago and they told me they will replace it immediately. Today still the same problem and it’s even dangerous as the wire is open. I told the staff guy that I suffered from sinusitis and have to blow my long hair. I even asked him to give me the one in the women’s changing room for few minutes. He said the hair dryer is fixed. When I asked him how is it possible that in such a huge gym there is no other hair dryer, he told me that they didn’t bring the new hair dryer yet and there is no other one.

You enter using a card or bracelet, which is great since it's open 24/7. The only bad thing is that some of the members, don't put their plates and dumbbells back where they belong.",05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 11:59PM

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded.",05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 11:59PM

They have a chat, which main purpose seems to relay a message ""Fill in the online contact form"". When you do, there is a waiting time from hours to days.

But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.

Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

I live in Tilst, but the Fitness World there basically has no classes at all.. maybe a handful spread over the week and often mornings.

If the sauna is not down, then the steambath is down, and it takes months for them to fix. The steambath has currently been down for 2-3 months, and before the steambath broke down, the sauna was down for an equally long time. Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while.

I chose this gym because it was the cheapest from the town. Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.
When I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership. The staff is hardly speaking English.
I strongly recommend to avoid this gym.",05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM
