Lea Hansen,5,"Can't complain. They do their job very well and are nice to help. I love the classes and there is many to choose from. I look forward to Denmark opening up properly again so we don't need masks in the gym though üòâ
Update! No masks! So nice! I've missed it!ü•∞",PureGym
Marcus Nyg√•rd,2,"Big gym spanning 3 floors. Good selection of benches and power racks. All equipment is of the lowest quality possible (Technogym) and has clearly been compromised to maximize profits. This lack of care for traning quality also becomes strenghtend by obscure rules, such as backpacks/gymbags or similar being forbidden in the gym. Receptionist staff are all super friendly and helpful, and the ALL-IN and heatwave yoga are excellent offers. This gym is very good at everthing not related to actual training. Would recommend if your looking for a cheap place to just do cardio and some strength training.",PureGym

Harald Frisch,2,"Nice enough local centre, but many of the machines are broken (and have been for the past several months without being fixed) and other machines are so badly maintained that it's a matter of relatively little time before they break.
There is also a super bad culture in relation to cleaning, the likes of which I have never seen.
The staff are nice enough, although they are not around very often.",PureGym

Note that unlike most other gyms in the area, this particular Fitness World allows a cheaper membership that is ONLY valid for this one location. If you don't want access to multiple locations, this can yield extra savings.",PureGym

John Doe,1,"The center at Dannebrosgade made my subscription go from 99 kr, to 259 kr. An increase of 161% the price.

They try to buy every succesfull center in Odense, to dominate the market, and then it becomes worse from there.

They also have Urban Gym which started at 99 kr, but is now 119 kr or something, even though they said they would not raise the price in the beginning.",PureGym

Soledad Vega,1,"I do not want to NEVER return to this center, unfortunate at first impression is what counts, although the teachers do a great job, if the receptionist shows her worst education and humor on a Saturday at 8 in the morning when you go happy to your  bike class and they ruin your morning because they almost treated you as a ""thief"" for taking a bike shoe (which of course you paid for before) from the counter (where in ALL the Odense centers of Fitness world you only go and take them) to  exception of the center of Tarupvej where you have to wait (even if you don't have time to wait because nobody and nobody is around to answer your call) that the receptionist comes to carry out the ""simple"" task of passing your shoes because you are not ""authorized""  to cross that very important and impenetrable downtown area !!!!",PureGym

Frederik Sandberg,4,"Bondovej gym has been my regular and favorite gym for the last 2 years. Primarily because, in my opinion, it is the best pure gym center in this part of OdenseüôÉ

equipment :
there is a lot of different equipment to choose from and it mainly consists of technogym plateloaded and machines as well as cable towers and there is a good mix of new and old, which appeals to me as I am a fan and often like the old equipment best. There is a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãgrips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row ü§´

Atmosphere/premises:
The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! ü•∞

Service:
The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat ü´†they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odenseüòâ",PureGym

Winnie Vorsatz,4,"This gym offers all items, equipment and facilities that you would need. There are two big weightlifting areas (including barbells, dumbbells and machines), a big cardio area (treadmills, crosstrainer, stepper, cycles, ...), an area with the usual workout machines, a TRX area and in the one weightlifting area you have some open space to do your own workout (there are spinning ropes, medicine balls, kettleballs, asults, ringes, etc.). Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat). And I really like the 'freestyle' courses like Crossfit and Functional, because they include different equipments and are usually with only a few people so the trainer can focus on you. Everything is very clean, including the shower facilities. There is also a sauna and a steam bath. The ladies changing room comes with big mirrors, hair dryers and hair straightener. It's usually not to crowded and in my opinion super cheap (99 DKK for students).",SATS

Rune Perstrup,1,"An Unhygienic Coronavirus Petri Dish.

I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously.",PureGym
Mario Piazza,1,"In a huge gym there is only one hair dryer and it‚Äôs not working. I asked the staff to fix it one week ago and they told me they will replace it immediately. Today still the same problem and it‚Äôs even dangerous as the wire is open. I told the staff guy that I suffered from sinusitis and have to blow my long hair. I even asked him to give me the one in the women‚Äôs changing room for few minutes. He said the hair dryer is fixed. When I asked him how is it possible that in such a huge gym there is no other hair dryer, he told me that they didn‚Äôt bring the new hair dryer yet and there is no other one. Unacceptable.",PureGym
Emil Lassen,5,"It's a great gym with basically everything you could want or need, there is access to lockers both in the dressing rooms and when you enter the center. You enter using a card or bracelet, which is great since it's open 24/7. The only bad thing is that some of the members, don't put their plates and dumbbells back where they belong.",PureGym
Frank Ejby Poulsen,3,"The gym is great, spacious and has everything, and the personel is friendly and helpful.

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded.",PureGym

Angi Las,1,"The Studio is not in best Shape. As Many before me wrote: it‚Äôs very small, the devices are packed!! Could be a lot cleaner - especially the toilets.
But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don‚Äôt know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain ‚Äûannoyed‚Äú attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.
Will go to another fitness world studio in the future and hope that the next one will be more modern and clean und the staff maybe a little more educated.",PureGym

So I'd say it all goes relatively well until one needs to talk to someone beyond the helping guys in the centre. The company doesn't have a phone number to call. They have a chat, which main purpose seems to relay a message ""Fill in the online contact form"". When you do, there is a waiting time from hours to days.

But to my big astonishment, it was an opt-in subscription service, so I was actually billed for the next month without even being notified beforehand! I cancelled it right away but I had to pay for that month anyway. So I used it a few times.

Krzysztof Turczyn,4,"This place is great!
They have all you need and they're open 24 hours, if it was even a bit dirty it's because lazy members do not know how to behave! People working there are trainers and office staff they are not your slave and they are not there to clean you mess! But there is one thing that drives me crazy and I was trying to ignore it but it is a bit hard now... the music when the staff leaves. If any staff employee of FW is reading it, can you PLEASE contact the staff in this gym and asked them to when they leave at 8 PM maybe set some radio or some motivational music? There was this one day that the song got stuck it was play allllllllllll night long, the same one song, and it was not even a good one, and literally after 40 mins I left coz not even my headphones helped.

Often leaving weights where they use them, don't clean the machines after use and often sit for a long time looking at their phones. The gym is not staffed all the time and so no one tells these children to clean up after themselves.

Mike Martins,1,"The average age of the members in this gym must be somewhere around 17/18 at the most.

Other than that, the gym is very dirty and messy (This is also due to most of these teenagers neither sanitizing/cleaning up after themselves) and the music is too loud as well as being very poorly choiced songs.",PureGym

The air ventilation does not seem to work properly, though.",PureGym

RUECKENWIND,1,"I'm shocked after reading reviews that are just 3 years old (urban gym) compared to today. Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

The only good thing are the other people, most of them are friendly. The gym itself is just disgusting and not worth the money. That's just the review for that certain location.",PureGym

Another low point is the door system letting you in the gym, which keeps denying you the entrance if you're not perfectly positioned inside the cabin - too much fuss for nothing.

Dan Leonhardt,2,"Wasted potential. This could be a good gym, but their obvious desire to minimize spending really hurts the customer experience.

Equipment is broken for weeks (sometimes months) at a time. Showers work intermittently, and when down, also take weeks to fix.

Locker room has lots of almost all half size lockers (many of which are broken) and these are only half occupied even at peak times. So why not install a room of full length lockers and keep them in working order? That would cost money. Can't do that it would seem.

There was a steam room. It was closed in early 2022, supposedly due to high energy prices at the time. Never reopened. No reason given, other then the ridiculous argument that somehow, by keeping it open, the whole business would fail and the gym would then have to close down.

And the minimal staffing means there's nobody to enforce the rules (CLEAN THE MACHINE WHEN YOU ARE DONE!) or do little things like fill up soap dispensers in the bathrooms and showers.",SATS

C L,5,5-star rating for the second floor lounge. I was running around the park 630am and needed a bathroom and a coffee. SATS is perfect for just that. I didn‚Äôt try the gym. Neither do I see the point of paying for cardio machine when you are so close to a beautiful park in summertime.,SATS
Guido Nap,3,"The gym is ok, although with rising prices I guess it became a bit expensive for what it offers. It is a bit small but very modern and fairly clean. At least more than other gyms I have seen in Copenhagen. It is often packed when it comes to using the barbell stations but definitely, I have seen it worse.

The staff is usually nice, although when you have a question (e.g. about billing etc.) it is all managed in a very confusing way. I do not think is their fault, but rather something related to their internal procedures and IT systems.

The classes are in Danish, but you can also find classes in English. Besides the language barriers, I find the classes useful and entertaining. Usually, the instructors are of a good level and there is quite a good variety.

The app is a welcome help for booking classes and other functions, although sometimes the user experience could be improved (and the same with the website).

I am still a client and I think the gym has the potential though to become even better. It depends on what the management will make out of it.",SATS

They have everything you need including 6 squat racks / power cages and a bunch of free weight stuff, cardio machines. The only thing lacking is team workout.

No place to combine jumping, weights and floor exercises. You should also put a few pairs of small barbels upstairs, so I don't need to go to another universe to fetch pair of 3kg weights. It is also super hot inside, which is weird since it is below 0 degrees these days in Copenhagen. I was told that summer is unbearable.

------
Pretty decent gym, still missing some basic equipment here and there, but overal it‚Äôs a quite okay gym. Some problems I have with this facility:

- Only having one leg extension machine
- No proper pull-up bars with the possibility to do different grips
- Overall, too small free weight section that 9/10 times reeks of testosterone. Literally. It stinks.
- Don‚Äôt bother going on weekdays between 16:30/19:00, then your workout will last more than twice as long because of the amount of waiting on equipment and machines.
- The music in the downstairs area is way too loud most of the times. If there was a boxing class going on, fair enough, but that‚Äôs usually not the case.
- Classes that take place (and they do a lot) on the rubber matting downstairs take up a lot of space, time and equipment. I make the effort avoiding going to the gym around those times because there won‚Äôt be any equipment left to use.

Good things:
- Loads of space compared to other gyms
- Has equipment that regular (cheaper) gyms don‚Äôt have > think more CrossFit minded gym set-up
- Enough squat racks (on quiet moments of the day)
- Eleiko weight plates, we like that
- Both mens and womens barbells
- Centrally located
- People training here are more professionally minded, keep to themselves and don‚Äôt bother others > the mindset and vibe in this gym is very pleasant.

But other than that it has everything you need and it‚Äôs okay priced when you‚Äôre a student just visiting this facility. Otherwise, I would probably find a different gym.",SATS

R Lu,2,"While it is spacious and with the ability to brag about a wide variety of equipment, the standard of several machines, is low. Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.

While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)
The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.

All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.",SATS

Dan Leonhardt,2,"General vibe bad. Situation seems like: ""We know we're not going to renew this lease, so let's put in the minimum effort and money and keep the place open."" They really should clean the equipment better, and more frequently, than they do.

You've only got about a 75% chance that the steam room is working in the men's lockers (and this was before they made up the lame excuse of energy cost). It often breaks, and stays broken for long periods of time, and has been closed for over a year and a half as of summer of 2023. No idea why they can't keep this running. There was also a missing plank in the sauna bench that took over 6 months to fix. So, maintenance is pretty bad all around.

The price has gone up efven though is the same facilities and the latest months there has not been half of the facilities f.e sauna and showers, due to renovation. I can understand that there is a strive for keeping the gym in shape but its a really bad timing to bump up my subscription when I only can use half of the facilties. By the way, the facilties are still dirty.
-Servicewise : I've trained there for two years and never got a hi or bye, that should say something about their service",SATS
Randy Schroeder,5,Mohamad was a great help and went above and beyond. The customer service is top notch and I would recommend Sats to everyone!,SATS
Igoris Oblozko,4,Its a good facilty with 2 floors for working out. All of the staff members are nice and always greet me and tell me goodbye when i leave. Not giving 5 stars because the mens toilet always smells bad. Not counting that a solid 4 stars,SATS
Christian Pedersen,2,"The locker rooms and bath facilities are in terrible condition. Rusty, dirty, and simply worn-out and broken. Also, the young people at the front desk are either not there or are sitting in the lounge area looking at their mobile phones. At least they could swipe the floor.",SATS
Lorah Rui Zhao,1,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but this is by far the worst gym I have tried in my life. Equipments are old, staff is not friendly/welcoming, minimal classes outside work hours (who‚Äôs going to them?!?), no warning that cycling classes need your own shoes (what a waste of time turning up) and I was told there will be English classes (no one spoke English). Save yourself the hassle and join another gym or are all gyms this terrible in cph?",SATS
Patrik P√©terdi,1,Horrible internet connection. Staff knows about it and it brings frequent complaints but the management won‚Äôt do anything about it.,SATS

Alexander Elz,2,"Poor service for the price, but its the same with most gyms in copenhagen. Standard equipment, short opening times, very small facility and lack of good hygiene. Membership is way to complicated and overpriced.
Staff is usually nice and its not crowded.",SATS
Diego Ulloa Iglesias,1,"The star is only for friendly staff.
The gym itself is a mess, and looks like no one is keeping it clean.
Sauna not working. Showers are under renovation but they didn‚Äôt install emergency showers either. Not even to mention the changing area ü§¢ with old fashioned method of lockers.",SATS
Michael Angl√© Bj√∏rklund Caspersen,1,"The pictures of the gym must be atleast 10+ old, because the place looks nothing like that. Alot of old equipment, areas that looks like a storage room. Seems like the owner just doesn't care about the state of the place.",SATS

Michael Stig Daugaard,3,Ok,SATS
Casper sorensen,2,"I have been coming here on and off for 5 years. And it gets worse every time I return!
The hygiene in the bath and sauna is under all criticism! Toilet paper, bottles and water on the floor! This is not an isolated case! There needs to be a stronger member policy in the house and more cleaning

Training facilities etc are good",SATS
Lillian Bekker,5,"A nice training centre, with good opportunities for self-training with - or without the use of machines and for booking on different teams, if you want. There is a good atmosphere when you walk in the door, and it is my clear impression that the employees do their best to ensure that Sats - R√∏dovre continues to be a nice place to visit.",SATS

david t. B.,4,"Very nice quite large fitness center. Plenty of equipment. Almost always vacant treadmills, bikes and cross trainers. Large spinning studio and two other studios for classes. Staff is very friendly, and people are in general nice. I have been a member the last ten years. There are no xxx heavy dumbbells which keeps away the pro body builder type. You can buy a quite large assortment of fitness beverages energy bars and coffee in the cafe.",SATS

Gulins P,3,Some of the equipment is old and the facilities could be a lot cleaner. The atmosphere is relaxed though.,SATS
Tommy Alias Supperap,1,"Partly reasonable gym in the morning and afternoon, but after that it goes downhill. The evening is terrible: shouting groups of young boys who mostly use Sats as a youth club. But the worst part is that it is filthy in the evening - especially the toilets and bathrooms. There is a lot of snuff and wool from socks in the bathroom that needs to be cleaned - and no one mops the floor (neither staff nor users). The sauna and steam bath (closed) are clammy after a whole day of sweat. People use their own rules regarding the sauna, e.g. having an unofficial party with music in the sauna, so that others cannot enter without stinking of peppermint. The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open). There is also a lot missing compared to previously under Fitnessdk, for example. free coffee. The quality is just decreasing and the clientele is going in the wrong direction: more suspicious types in the evening (and it's not the ones from Gentofte).

Bad gym!!!",SATS
Kim Hansen,1,"Flood in mens bath, sauna and steam bath often broken and maybe 8 out of 150 lockers actually work.. So you need to bring your stuff around the gym",SATS
Louis Hamilton,5,Best workout center,SATS
Henrik Forsstr√∏m,4,"Nice center with brand new, beautiful bathing facilities. There is both a steam bath, a sauna and plenty of space.
The exercise machines are not all the latest and that drags you down. There are plenty of opportunities to look out over Herlev town center and I like the air it gives to a training center that there are windows with a view.
There is also a bit of CrossFit.",SATS
Stefan Eriksen,5,"After having been a member of Fitness World for 10 years, I chose to switch to rate and keep then a difference. Better machines, more dumbbells, and much more welcoming staff. It is clearly the best decision I made when I chose to switch to rate.",SATS

Otherwise, I was happy to come there, so I hope they will soon get the various things under control so that I can come back.",SATS
Anders Jeppesen,4,"Great fitness centre with nice new facilities. Only downside is the 2 hour limit on the free parking and a limit number of immediate parking spaces. It is usually not a problem.

At this location, they have a live DJ from 4 to 8 PM on Monday evenings, and at the other location they have a live DJ at the same time on Tuesday evenings. It‚Äôs quite amazing for the price! It‚Äôs a nice thing to have as well to spice up the workout.

If you dont speak Danish, it is probable to get overcharged by mistake because some of the staff are not well-trained with the system besides having language barrier. I paid fee for extra months while my membership was supposedly on pause. They sent me bills without even sending me a notification about reactivation beforehand. At the end of the complicated way through the customer service, the result was: ""I understand you but sorry we cant do anything, you have to pay the money"". Yeah, this is sad to pay fee for months when you could have attended the gym but you were unaware.
That was by far my poorest experience of customer service in Denmark.",PureGym

suverenia,1,"Very expensive place considering that the sauna and steam bath never work properly. If the sauna is not down, then the steambath is down, and it takes months for them to fix. The steambath has currently been down for 2-3 months, and before the steambath broke down, the sauna was down for an equally long time. Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while. The bench is bent and unstable, and the walls of the sauna are getting ripped apart. And noone gives a damn.

sachin kamble,5,Among all the centers in Aarhus. This particular center has the sauna facility. New and well designed. Can be too much crowded after 15:00 until 20:00,PureGym
Vera K,4,"I really enjoy Fitness World on Jens Baggesens vej. They have the best choice of training classes in Aarhus to my knowledge. I live in Tilst, but the Fitness World there basically has no classes at all.. maybe a handful spread over the week and often mornings.
So it is definitely worth driving to this other Fitness World with lots of evening classes and friendly staff.

The only thing is that in summer it can get very hot inside and the air is thick. So the ventilation can't keep up with the amount of people training.",PureGym
Miko≈Çaj ‚ÄúZ≈ÇƒÖczka‚Äù Chomacki,5,They say biggest gym in scandinavia. This place is really cool! People are lovely. Can bit crowded in aftetnoons,PureGym
Mika Summanen,5,Amazing cardio classes with great atmosphere!,PureGym
Thai Hiep Bui,1,"Quantity over quality, very over rated, expensive. Poor cleaning and poorly organized both from the customers and the employees. Dumbbells lying everywhere, weight bars every where on the floor, racks missing dumbbells for days is a normal thing. So many machines that are so close to each other it is impossible to move around without hitting something by accident. Not very friendly staff.",PureGym
Daran Young,5,Fantastic place to stay fit!,PureGym
Frano.0k,5,well equiped and very kind staff ‚ò∫Ô∏è always smiling,PureGym
Anders Kl√ºver,3,"Not as many good classes anymore. TRX and functional training classes are great for strength and cardio, but difficult to find a good class",PureGym
Emma H,5,"Great gym! So many good offers for memberships and lots of machines and equipment. The only negative thing I would say is that nobody is brining towels to have with them, which has usually been a requirement at gyms I go to. Therefore if people don't use the paper towels to clean you sometimes find a machine that is really sweaty and dirty and you have to clean it yourself! I think it would be nice if they changed that and asked people to bring towels for hygienic reasons. But otherwise I love the gym and would recommend! Really friendly staff too!",PureGym
Klaus Pedersen,5,"Great place to do your workout. New and always good maintained equipment, and their team activities are always with good instructors. Like most of the other Fitness World centers it's really good.",PureGym
goran kozina,5,Very big space with lot of good machines in good state. Very friendly staff.,PureGym
Klaus Pedersen,5,"I like this center. Great location, great opening hours and a great size. It's not too big nor to small. I primarily attend the classes and find that they have great instructors. The locker rooms are nice and clean.",PureGym
Lars Steenfeldt-Gjers√∏e,4,"Nice fitness center, they have a lot of squat racks, free weights and cardio machines. They do lack some of the traditional machines.",PureGym
Rosendal,3,"It's fine for what it is, but half the lockers can't lock properly, and the machines are quite worn down.",PureGym
Nikolaj Johannes Skole Jensen,4,"One of the better fitness centers, at least in the ""Fitness World"" line-up",PureGym
Dennis Au,2,Cluttered and strangely structured center. Disabled toilet and stretcher in the same room,PureGym
–ø–∞–≤—É–∫ –ë–æ–¥—è,1,"I think I am gonna quit that GYM, the same playlist for 5 months.....It's make me crazy. No way the reason of quitting will be music.... Please change it",PureGym
bendix holtgraefe,4,"Great fitness studio with nice and helpfull staff. The only drawback is the very unflexible membership system. I'm working abroad every other month and there is no suitable membership plan for a situation like this. I'm required to pay 100 DKK everytime I want to pause my membership when starting work, which isnt very nice.",PureGym
Jakub Wieczorek,4,Clean but have some old equipment that could be replaced,PureGym
Klaus Pedersen,5,Great fitness center with good classes. I've been very pleased with the friendliness and professionalism among their instructors and staff. It is a place you like to work out.,PureGym
Myriam D,5,"Great place, nice separation of floors, clean.",PureGym
Maria,2,"Bad vibes! Too many people, especially at this FW is starring at you if you actually do a good job and are serious about training. To fit in, you should stare at your phone and don‚Äôt pay attention to exercise at all.. ü´§ It‚Äôs a shame.. The culture makes me change to FitnessX !!",PureGym
Antonin Fronc,5,"Clean gym with everything I need for general bodybuilding purposes. Although some equipment is visibly worn out and the gym may be crowded at times, it's not a reason to complain given the price and 05:00-24:00 opening times.",PureGym
Angel Del Fabbro,2,"Really Cheap fitness chain. Nothing luxury. Nothing to make the experience better. Dated cardio machines. Everything feel old. No improvements in 10 years in technology applied to training or experience. Quite dirty, low maintenance. Dirty change rooms, not even soap in showers. Weird people hanging out but not training. Unfortunately they are like a monopoly, not other options in the city. Danes have high income but the gyms are really lame and basic compared to other countries.",PureGym
Ben Brownlee,4,"A good part of the Fitness World chain of gyms. Not their biggest gym in Aarhus, but it is spacious and well laid out. There are areas for cardio, machines, circuit training, free weights and a well-placed number of squat racks. Two large rooms are available for group classes.

The recent refurb has given a well deserved refresh to the place. Staff were very attentive when we were coming out of the covid restrictions. They seem to have fallen back into old patterns since. But are generally friendly and are there to help out.

My second favourite Fitness World in Aarhus.",PureGym
Gabe Avenia,3,"Gym is decent, but there is no air-conditioning in the summer which makes it just unbearable. Also no WiFi and mediocre maintenance.",PureGym
Bardia Varasteh,1,"The staffs are super nice that is why I give this star for them.
But sorry that I cannot add any more stars since the center is super crowded! No matter when you go! Early morning! Evening! Week days weekends.... I think they should introduce some rule and dont accept new members since the center is too small for the people wanna to do workout! The last two times I had to just leave since I could not find any free spot to do workout!",PureGym
Lucian Constantin,2,Pretty bad compared to the other places fitness world centers I've been to in Aarhus,PureGym
Tom,4,"Nice staff, clean. But missing simple things like a holder for soap in the shower, more ""cleaning stations""",PureGym

Poul Wrist,4,"Decently equipped gym. Good amount of free weights, machines and other features.",PureGym
Andreea - Madalina Balas,4,The machines are new and the stuff is very friendly and ready to assist.,PureGym

Davor Jovanov,5,Good place to relax and get fit,PureGym
Konrad P≈Çecha,5,"Great place, a lot of machines and heavy lifting space, big fitness room suitable for stretching or warming up session.",PureGym
Badrinath Veluri,1,"It is new facility and the equipment is worst. I have seen many not in working mode even after few days.

Treadmills are worse and not installed properly. They are very tiresome and I have said many times to the staff but no actions.

The staff is kind and good but no action towards the improvements we suggest.",PureGym
Mike Kosiakov,5,"Good local fitness center. Rush hours from 17 to 19, better go after or before these hours. Please, add new music videos.",PureGym
Ahmet E,5,Just love it,PureGym
Jesper S√∏kb√¶k,3,"Not the biggest Fitness World, you can safely say, there aren't many parking spaces. So you have to stop at Bilka if you come in prime time, i.e. around 16 to 18:00.

The place is open until 00:00 on weekdays, so that everyone can get a workout in. There isn't bikefit and all that cycling like in the really big centres.",PureGym
Lenka ≈†vidrnochov√°,5,"Amazing spacy gym with long opening hours, parking and modern machines.",PureGym
BƒÖc≈Çaw xD,3,"Tge gym is fine, but people here do not put weigths on their place",PureGym
Aleksejs Krasovskis,1,Do not recommend if you don't want to be boiled. It's too hot inside and no proper ventilation.,PureGym
Ben Brownlee,4,"A good-sized gym on several floors, with a large variety of free weights, machines and classes. Not the tidiest Fitness World you'll find; weight plates often strewn around the area rather than stacked on a weights tree.",PureGym
Sreejit Dey,5,"The environment is nice to workout.
The equipments are in very good condition.
But only there is a bit more rush in the afternoon..",PureGym
Thai Hiep Bui,1,"Members do not clean after themselves, do not put the weight back
The gym is messy and dirty. The floor is nasty. The weights are everywhere but on the racks. The bottom floor that is in the cellar is humid as hell. Equipments are not maintained and a lot of them are broken or have flaws. The rubber bands that are available for use are so dirty and sticky. The only reason I keep the membership is because it is literally 2 minutes from where I live. Do not recommend to anyone, not worth the money.",PureGym
Par Kla,2,"The equipment looks like all the broken leftovers from the other gyms. The usual guests have no manners. No one puts equipment back in their place, the gym always looks like a mess.",PureGym
alex billesb√∏lle,4,You can sweat here :-),PureGym
Peter Dam Mains,2,"Always messy, and the equipment/machines are cheap.",PureGym
Marck Vilstrup,5,God service,PureGym
Ons Hmouda,4,"Very good impression and you'll find everything you need, the only missing thing is the sauna, it's on time out in all SATS gyms in malm√∂ :-/",SATS
Robin G.,5,"Very well equipped gym, personnel very nice. But for me the best are the members: they always clean after themselves in general, are respectful and it‚Äôs not super crowded üòä",SATS
Marco Schnepf,5,"Used the gym when I was visiting Malm√∂.  Everything you need, staff is very friendly. Will be back on my next trip. Thank you",SATS
dominic nwaejike,5,Nice training centre for body build up friendly environment and good equipment,SATS
Zmicier Vaskovich,1,"Is it ever going to be open? No electricity in the building in three days, how come you can't fix it? So annoying.",SATS
Erfan Nasoori,4,"Nice staff.
Spacious.
However the Big group training area's floor is almost fully broken. Everywhere there you step on, you may twist your ankle. As time goes by, it gets worse.",SATS
Hesham Alkurdi,1,The staff will try to make you feel unwelcome and uncomfortable or they just hate their jobs so much. SATS should train the staff and teach them how to be nice and help people.,SATS
Christian Engelund (Nordrir),5,"Good gym, always clean, mostly well maintained, plenty of space and possibilities, group trainings, etc. They also have agreements with various companies for offers on membership.

There are two group training rooms, a large cardio section, big section of machines, cross-fit section, and rather large weight section. Dressing rooms have bathrooms, large mirrors, plugs for dryers and shavers, seating area, showers, and sauna.",SATS
Claes Larsson,2,"Old and No ergonomic equipment for free weights.
Benches are broken and probably at least 30 years old. They cannot fold due to broken mechanisms.
Towers are old and half broken.

Seriously one of the worst equipped gyms I have seen.",SATS
Sanne Wintr√©n,3,"The gym is very clean and fresh. I would give it 5 stars if they had som dance, afro, step and zumba. I really miss my dance-classes from my last gym.",SATS
