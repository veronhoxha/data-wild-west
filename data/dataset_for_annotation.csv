Arne Ziebell Olsen,5,"This applies only to Gentofte/Lyngbyvej and Oslo Square. Good functional-right machines. Lovely teams with a ORDENT floor that doesn't load the joints and tendons, and the right lighting, ALWAYS clean - all over, and always friendly and welcoming staff:-)"
Anette,5,"Great selection of machines and team training. Clean centers, calm and welcoming atmosphere. Super service-minded staff. Professional and motivating instructors, with targeted training. It's fun to be on hold, it's nice to step in the door, I always meet a smile on my lip."
Laura Lacziko,4,"The mood is good, and the place is large enough and has a good selection of equipment. I would like if there was a rule about going outside the shoes out at the entrance and also cleaning the shower drain system more often. Hair gets clogged up up there and it smells. It would also be nice if everyone could contribute more by, for example, putting the weights back where they belong!!!"
Hanne Andersen,5,Feel welcome to me.Good directors.But please put up notes that the girls have to close the closet when they go. It annoys me boundlessly that they yawn and you walk into them.
Henriette Ini Bing,3,"I love my Zumba team at Ditte on the Library Road in Hvidovre.But the center is really dirty all over, you shouldn't look along,floor/walls, changing clothes, shower, toilet, in short, a very dirty center."
Lone,5,Clean and neat. Good bright rooms. Many and good machines. Helpful staff. Nice that you can choose to train in several centers.
Sucena Gomes,1,"creates me online as soon as I have paid and the money is taken from my account - it says ""couldn""t big entered data. Please try later it just happened again for the second time now. Also, you have to wait 8+ days before your money comes back in the account. For your own sake, just go straight down to the fitness center, and set up there - as it clearly doesn't work online •"
KELD VOLDER,5,A nice gym with good harmony and room for everyone regardless of the level of ambition.There are new colours everywhere and employees clean up and clean up when needed.
Jakob Søndergaard,4,"Puregym is a very good gym with a wide range of training machines etc. There are good bathroom conditions, nice and clean and staff - which are friendly and helpful. It is clearly recommended to choose this center."
Peter Birk,4,"A good and clean gym with welcoming employees.Some of the rowing machines are inoperative, and weight benches are missing for the stomach and back exercises in a lying state."
Christine ,5,"It is always a good experience to get to the center - smiling and sweet employees. A cozy and nice atmosphere everywhere. Everyone is welcoming, and you are just part of the community from day one. There are so many cool teams on the team plan that it can be difficult to choose •"
Stephanie,3,There should be some class teaching where you learn how to use the machines... it's annoying that you can't learn it incl. in your membership Good service but better reception of new cue be Nice... i.e. tour of the machines etc.
Brian,3,Training in Pure Gym has recently become a deteriorated experience. Cleaning and maintaining machines are heavily decreased as well as the purchase of various options are saved away.
Dorte Eisensø,4,"A smaller center- nice, untied and neat and clean. Most staff are sweet and friendly"
josi bjerre,1,Rødovre center has fallen dramatically in service and you don't feel very welcome.The café area is under all the criticism that is lacking chairs/table and the bar chairs are put together with tape!!Water in the shower is almost not existing!The instructors on the team are super
Thomas Rindom,4,"It is simple and straightforward to use Puregym on Emdrumvej. There is what should be if you do not require team training. If you have your own plan of exercises, the place is fine at a go price."
Anita  Sørensen,5,Lots of space and many machines you can use. Super nice staff.
greta ,4,The good team and the good coach make me look forward to Monday morning with a smile on my lip.
Anni,5,"It was a good experience because of the director. It was a bad experience because of the bathing conditions. The Rist had stopped, so we sow in water.Other days it is a bad experience when I exercise myself in the hall, and there is only one round stick for shoulder exercises!"
Lene Andersen,4,PureGym in Værløse is a good place to train.Especially Zumba and ThaiBo are my favorite with a lot of lovely people on the teams.
Charlotte Pape,5,Many different teams - so there's something for everyone
Lillian Dalsgaard,5,Skillful instructors and lovely members of the senior team. The interest of the other participants is motivating to show up.
Jette,3,I think it's too long to get on Annette Løvgren's team in Mariendal. You should make more teams with her when you open the list then is but number 47? and there is October 23?
kunde,3,Old machines - time for upgrades. More welcoming staff could be desired
 Torben,4,Almost everything is perfect at PureGym in Sønderborg
Charlotte Pedersen,1,"Friday the 22/9 I paid with a personal training card. The amount is drawn 2 times on my card. Today on 9/10 I still haven't received what has been drawn too much, despite the fact that the money should have been here by today!In my optics it is certainly not good customer service!So some came that the money...BUT there is still 258kr, I MUST HAVE ALL RETURN!!!! THE ERROR IS 100% JERES!!!"
Michael Sigil,4,"Nice place to train, lots of room from the morning."
Janni,5,Cute and competent staff both at reception and in the team room.
Kunde,5,I've been training for 1.5 months and I'm super fond of it.
weldu tesfamichael,5,"I'm happy if I train, and the bot I work in has purely cool music, so I work while I'm having fun"
Dzevdet Kazimi,5,I've trained at least 10 years and I'm so happy
Lena Rachlitz,5,For everyone. Good atmosphere and many opportunities
Toni Jensen,5,Nice center and a good atmosphere. It is easy to be inspired by others who train
Trine Bay,4,"Good space, good atmosphere and nice large locker room."
Sylvester Kirketerp Kristensen,1,"Despite expensive membership there is no service and a lot of problems. First day starts out that you have to pick up your card at the reception, however, you cannot get to the reception without a card and when you press the bell there is nothing. When you finally have your card continues the problems. Come down to train, check in, see I have forgotten the mik water bottle, home after it, come back and can not come in. There are no employees to help, before customer service to call, or anything. Will recommend everyone to choose a different center than pure gym."
Evelyn R,5,Cozy small training spot under FW/Puregym •
Claus Aasholm,5,Good center where ordinary people feel welcome and comfortable. Lots of gear and activities.
Bente,3,It lags behind in replacing worn-out equipment.
Annemette Uhre,5,Super sweet and present staff Good atmosphere in the center
Mette Damving,5,Friendly and good atmosphere when I enter PureGym.
Bent Ludvigsen,5,"Good training conditions, a wide range of machines, nice staff and not least a skilled and motivating personal trainer."
Peder Kirkegaard Sørensen,5,"I like the relaxing environment where you are also your own ""doctor "" and can get guidance when needed."
Victor Due,3,"It's okay, but there's no air circulation, so you're totally dying when you work out."
Sine,4,"Good room, nice atmosphere, incoming staff."
Alice Callesen,2,"Music in the spinning room is too loud. High music is in the long run harmful! Set up sound meter that can give hints about how high to play. Spinning bikes need to be cleaned. They are filled with sweaty salt! Generally, I think it lags with cleaning all around. Otherwise, ok center is about hold."
Maja Kornerup,5,Has always been super satisfied with •Pure Gym • in WAVES •
Kirsten,1,"I went down and joined the center and they were super nice and helpful. They joined me and made me an offer that I agreed to, but they didn't inform me that there was a six-month bond.When I resigned about two weeks later, since I thought there were too little machines, I wrote to customer service and explained the misunderstanding when it was only there I discovered it. They said it wasn't their fault, but my responsibility since it was on the receipt, and they refused to help. After a conversation back and forth where I asked them if we could find a solution, I got rude messages back, but at last they changed the resignation.This was a super frustrating experience where I felt cheated and downed by the staff. Even though we had changed the date of the termination, I didn't report back to PureGym if this is the way in which they solved misunderstandings, whether or not."
Bo Østergaard,5,Good atmosphereSweet staff Clean rooms
Hans Petersen,4,Good locations and bright rooms with many activities. Meet staff with a high level of service. Clean machines and locations and the possibility of a cup of coffee in comfortable chairs and sofas. A little breakfast on Fridays with a smile on their lips.
Karina  ,5,Good atmosphere. Clean and neat
Sumbal,1,"For over 2 months I tried to get in touch with an employee who is in charge of company-paid agreements. Since you have changed from fitnessworld to Puregym, it is not possible to extend its subscriber!I contacted staff in various centers, Puregym customer service chat 3 times, which refers to the company member email does not answer!! Now my subscriber has stopped as it has not been extended."
Jakob Kirial,5,Delicious Center that just plays with the loveliest happy staff and Manager Maria! Always smiling and welcoming.
Susanne Bentzen,5,"Good atmosphere, good equipment"
Rikke Olsen,1,"I'm happy to work out in my local pure gym, but I have to admit that the cleaning effort has fallen tremendously... there is crap and fuzz everywhere, not so much in the changing, but otherwise everywhere else...the baddest thing I've ever seen is today's date... considering strongly changing to another center."
Gitte Frikke,5,"Clean, nice and good machines.Good indoor climate. Is very happy to train there."
Maja,3,Missing more energy is being spent on improving the team instructors and equipment instead of spending money painting walls and putting so bad conditions for the instructors that they choose to change company..
Jacob Michaelsen,4,The Puregym in Kokkedal is a versatile and good gym that meets my training needs.
Oliverrp,5,The equipment was great. Good atmosphere. Meeting people.Super friendly employees. Just mega cozy.
Martin L,5,Always nice center to train in.
Jonas Vesth,1,"I tried to create a membership in a plus membership when you saved 30% for the next 6 months if you were a student. After I activated this discount on the website it wasn't activated when I had to pay when another campaign (which was more expensive) apparently overlapd the study discount.So I went down to one of your centers and tried to set me up there, but neither did I manage to get started with the 30% study discount, despite the employee calling her boss. Here she did a good attempt.So unfortunately it was the weekend and I couldn't contact customer service until after the weekend. In between the campaign is apparently over. I get written to the chat today and meet the most incompetent young worker who after I explained my situation, writes ""We unfortunately don't have the discount anymore."" There is absolutely no help to pick up from customer service from Oliver.."
kunde,5,"I've come through years and there's a friendly service, as well as good instructors."
Bodil,3,Ok center.
Viggo,5,Have been training in FW for many years and are happy about it. Fantastic staff in Cone Lion.
Stig Bertelsen,5,Holte pure gym....Lighty center
Hans Haid,5,"friendly, clean, good teams and machines"
Mikkel ,3,Not a large enough range of machines in my center. It's weeks before faulty machines are repaired.
Peter Olsen,5,It's nice to pull along with the mogen others.
claus andreasen,3,"The equipment is worn down many centers, something is directly dangerous. That should really invested in new equipment, greeting member since 2011"
Dorit Ibsen,4,"Very good and inspiring team training. However, there is a lack of team training in all centres."
Consumer,5,Pleasure clean and neat all over the place.
Susanne Henningsen,5,Friendly and happy service. which is clean and neat..also in the hooks
Hanne Bruun Blaabjerg,5,"Cozy place, good atmosphere, room for everyone, the personal trainers are skilled giving away a lot..It's a nice place to train"
Serguei Chiriaev,5,Well-equipped center with very friendly personal
Kim Thor Bakkendorf,2,"It has not yet been possible to remove the fans that cause false cooling and thereby accidental damage. This problem has been brought to the attention several times, both local and member service. Nothing has happened.In addition, many wear surfaces are worn and should have long since been replaced."
stina just,5,"Good machines that are a good atmosphere in the center, very nice staff"
HelleB-W,4,Missing tight up teams in Freedom and Library Road
Thomas Kirkegaard,5,"Good training conditions, clean and neat, well maintained, good instructors"
Henrik Brendstrup,5,Really a good center that understands that good atmosphere and a good relationship with customers is just as important as the equipment. I am very satisfied.
Lars T L,4,"Very difficult to report as there are so many different levels, from gym to gym."
LH,2,For old machines that break constantly.Treasers to get the machines replaced
Simon Thomassen,5,"I think it's very good that everything I need, I get help when I ask about it."
Mette,5,Inspiring director and glorious atmosphere for Bike
Jane Rohde Olesen,4,"Lovely quiet center that I need, but there is still poor ventilation and the machines that are in use must be fixed in the foreseeable future."
Eva Bang-Hansen,5,"Good training, good ambience, level to suit everyone"
nala2cheer,5,Good center on almost all points. The rest is up to the participant
Janus Morthorst,1,Forgot something in my car and goes down and comes back and now Pure Gym writes the card reader handback time.This was a very bad experience and therefore I can only give a star.Fix it now.
Marianne,4,There are many opportunities for varied training and many skilled instructors.The biggest minus is the indoor climate in the classrooms that is under all criticism.The employees are friendly and helpful.
Michael Ellegaard,5,"Keep the experience, with super relevant and skillful teaching"
Marianne Holbæk,5,Fantastic director..fun and amazingly good..
Christina,5,"Mega skilful in the architect (Anne Sofie, Viborgvej)"
Poul Tomsen,2,Machine park poor quality. Poor maintenance of machines.
Kirsten Halkier,5,Effective time with good instructor to tight up.
Michael,2,"In the past, it is very few that do this.Why don't you put up signs and draw attention to this."
Klaus,3,"There has gradually been general dissatisfaction among members, on the level of cleaning and on the condition of the machinery. The paradox is that the price has increased while the quality has gone down. In this respect, it is also disappointing to hear that the centre on Østervoldgade is apparently a low priority centre.Everything suggests that Østervoldgade could be a good centre: good size, in the middle city and delicious rooms, but it requires effort, in line with the one previously established.The centre has been run very competently in the FW days by female center managers, so no names have been mentioned."
Joakim,1,"Find another placeCreates me at the reception, he writes my mail wrong and I didn't think about it anymore at the moment, I thought I was bug created and didn't come any more. Find out 2 months later I now have to pay for 2 months, even if I haven't received emails or been in their center. A big mess."
Lissy Kristensen,4,"Good facilities, welcoming staff, fantastic team trainer"
NatchayaKhunnam,1,I wasn't allowed in changing room. Then came suddenly em manager and complained that there was a customer who said to her that I was on video calls with someone in changing rooms. I knew the manager my mobile screen that I was only on Al. Sound call. Then came suddenly em manager and complained that there was a customer who said to her that I was on video calls with someone in changing rooms. I knew the manager my mobile screen that I was only on Al. Sound call. Then she should look out about it and ask me first if it was true that I was doing it in changing rooms. I didn't have to change her case that I was also allowed to speak in changing rooms at Al. Call me!! In changing rooms!!!!!!!!)

Preben Valeur,1,I pay for my son who is now studying in Italy. We try not to pay first as it is enough for a statement in many places. But there is a bill coming. My son cannot sign up as I pay and I can't unsubscribe as the email address doesn't fit. It is closed for support this weekend and since I finally find a physical store with staffing it is October 1st. They know that he can't use the 2 extra months membership - since he is in Italy - which we are now forced to pay but yet demand that we pay for October and November - as their rules say. Very little service-minded. Find a better and cheaper place.
Consumer,5,"Zumba and tight up with Louise Pilgaard is one of the best. Best director who with his positive attitude manages to give us all sweat on the forehead and smile on the lip. Loves to train with her, and she gets my warmest recommendations."
Stine s. Punar,5,"PureGym gets 5 stars - have trained in the center - the centers for many years now also as it was called fitness world. I am very satisfied and could not imagine me training in other center. Good atmospheres and cute employee. Always clean and nice. However, I'm not quite happy with the new machines that come around, they're not made for small people. They're not as good as the old ones, fortunately they haven't changed out in all centers yet. But otherwise I can only recommend PureGym."
adam hansen,1,"Sign me up at the reception due to poor conditions, accepted. Anyway gets bill. Says up again this time with signature. Contacts the support that doesn't understand the problem - doesn't follow up as I point out the problem. Pays bill via sent app. Apparently not working. Gets new moves and now incasso. A dirty mess shop. Find another place. For your own sake."
malou pedersen,5,"Completely fantastic experience with good energy and sweat on your forehead. If you try bodyattack, I can definitely recommend Marie, who does a varied, hard and fun workout."
Consumer,3,"No climate facility and it makes there always stinks in the toilets and get too hot in the center in the summer and then it's too expensive to be a member.They're all about the apple juice and I'd like to praise the staff at the center for doing what they can, but there's one climate facility missing."
Anna Zejden,5,"Latin team training is recommended for everyone. You get plenty of good energy and create a good mood, just within 50 minutes. Fantastically skilled and sympathetic instructor and well seen songs make you happy for the rest of the day. You can't invest better in your physical and mental form!"
Christoffer Boesen,5,"Nice welcoming staff.It's always clean and nice.Good machines, some old people may need a shift.And there are plenty of new ones."
Kat Rosholm,1,"Expensive fitness center where you don't get enough for the money. Long notice period when you quit. Collects monthly payments, despite payment agreement, so suddenly you have to pay 600 kr. at once instead of 300 kr. per month. Lots of unforeseen fees. I have to get back to fitness X, that's for sure."
Sigrid Lehmann,5,Because Nicki Seneberg is the best director and manages to create the best atmosphere.
Srdjan Petrovic,5,It is nice that there is always clean and the machines are relatively new and ready for use.
Alicja Nowak,5,"The best community ever • Huge big gym, always clean top class, welcoming personnel, good music, phenomenal trainer (especially Nicki"
kunde,5,"In the years I've come here, it's always a friendly service."
Kasper Kudahl,1,"Almost impossible to reach someone over chat, should have quit my subscriber which teased. Couldn't get an employee over the website. Thought so succeeded and thought everything was fine. Now they've sent me a bill 2 months after I quit that I'm still a member.. mess!!"
Mette Lise Johansen,4,The Best Instructors
Dennis Sode,3,Many old fittnes machines as well as lack of maintenance
Rikke Erbs,3,"It's okay to workout, but there needs to be cleaned continuously."
Frank Ørsted,5,Nice and friendly employees a good place to train I'm happy with smiles
Jane Marie Højberg Jensen,5,"Super cute staff, and rarely crossed the gym."
Jesper Joes Petersen,1,"Extremely bad center in Elsinore.And in other cities it is rumoredAfter they have chosen to close 4 of the 7 toilets in the center and removed half of the lockers, out in the locker."
Sussie Persson,1,Maintaining 1 star - I could give less I did - reply from Lukas clearly shows that they were totally equally happy with the customers - and no she wasn't cleaning it was long gone. PureGym has become a money machine - had today - for the first time forgotten my card and had to have help getting in - the price of opening the door is 30 kr - that despite being a regular customer for almost 2 years and putting money in their store for 6 months at a time - I am furious it is by no means all right
Torben,4,"Good opening hours, usually easy to get to the machines. Super good feeling afterwards."
Pia Jellerup,3,I like most centres I've been in physically. I think that the level of team instructors has fallen a lot over time. How are your work environment and pay etc.? Why can't you keep the good instructors?
Casper23,5,"Our center is really good and the staff, led by Mike, are enormously accommodating and helpful."
Popsi,1,I tried a report a client out of pureGym it's completely impossible. Their service is not existing. Their instructions do not work. Super bad service. Popsi Kiel
John M�lich,5,"Cozy and nice people, I was welcomed by the staff. Good and focused environment in the training areas."
Steen Jæger,2,"A cardio machine park that is mildly indecent. The staff do what they can and there's nothing wrong there. But the center doesn't live up to any standard at all. Keep offers that are completely ridiculous. It seems as if the Sønderborg center has run out of the group's focus and just has to sail its own lake in the best possible way. It's almost embarrassing to say you train in PureGym in Sønderborg when you're asked where you're training. Now get the otherwise cool center updated to present standards. You see your advertising spots on TV in the center with advertising to train on various machines that so many people don't even find in the center. The other centres in town have gradually got new engine parks and chatter about people who go to other centers, which can be seen clearly at certain times when before there were many out to train in the morning/morning day for you to almost have the center for yourself today."
jan petersen,4,Good center.good facelites.good machines.a small minus for many teenagers use it as a living room
Rikke,5,"Good team, variety, great teachers"
Lars Lindsby,5,"PG-Stagehøjvej in Silkeborg is a smaller and worn but cosy and well equipped place to train with friendly and skilled employees,"
Noixbusiness s,1,Puregym is pure scam.The prices that stand on their website are misleading

Hanne,2,There is a lack of senior trainers.The cleaning has deteriorated
Melanie Jene Nielsen,5,Friendly employees and a lively place to train.
Henrik Weinrich,5,Good machines as well as fine rooms after it has got new colors.
ravnK,5,"Nice center with the cosyst atmosphere, service-minded employees and the best instructors.Counts all days and all teams."
Christina ,5,"Very good fitness chain, with good teams, good service, good machines and facilities."
Jonas Friis,1,"Not possible for free trial training, to see if you should switch to Puregym rather than the current gym. Cost 69kr. for a training. Never join PG on this basis."
Azam Yousaf,3,I didn't seem to appreciate the old loyal members. You keep chasing new members with offers. You should care for the old ones with e.g. giving the old members the same offer with cheaper subscriptions.
Kunde,4,Good instructor at bike team. Sweet fellow bikers.Unfortunately still poor bath conditions. Too low pressure on the water in the showers when we are more than 2 in the shower simultaneously •
Bettina Jennifer ,5,Trained for many years. Always a pleasure to get into Pure Gym. Nice and clean. Large selection of machines and accessories.
Nico,5,Good large bright rooms. Good selection of machines and friendly staff.
Oleksandra Khiubner,5,"Good location, enough equipment, what I need"
Frederikke K,1,"I can't change my subscription via the app/browser. Super super bad! Besides, it doesn't look like my student discount has been talked to."
Jakob S. Johnsen,5,"Good tools, great facilities, good atmosphere and welcoming staff."
Jens Corfitzen,5,"Bondovej good center, friendly staff and serious instructors"

Cherif El-Ayouty,5,Such a serious fitness center should be
Gilbert,4,Good staff
Jan Mercebach,2,"All too often, the center in Goaløv is disgusting and dirty!:(And the machine with the All-In products is fairly often out of service."
Rasmus,5,RIGITG fine centerGood atmosphereClean and neatGood machines
Dennis Corlin,5,Cozy center. Clean and neat. Serviceminded staff. Customize with tools.
Flemming Stucker,5,"High to the ceiling, and fantastic staff who keep clean and are always visible."
Lars Kruse,1,"During the transition from Fitness World to PureGym, old memberships have been allowed to continue at the double price - without making members aware of the new prices. It's cheating and deception. PureGym's member service has confirmed that they haven't alerted members to the changed prices. Therefore, check if you pay too much and which I have paid too much for about 6 months. Cheating and deception!"
Jesper V�ring Linddal,2,"Not much has happened in the center that was promised in the spring.There are other things to mention:-Sound dampening in the spinning room-Retention in the changing-That there would be control of the ventilation, which doesn't work 100%Little deaf, since after all it isn't cheaply use the centerMen super nice staff."
Finn Brandi,3,"The machines are okay, but when you train early in the morning it's not always clean and the sound level of the music is quite high"
Gitte Ellis,5,Good atmosphere and surroundings have got a nice uplift.You always feel welcome.
Jesper Kristiansen,1,Local centre Fredensborg closes October 1st
Pia Have Pedersen,5,"Clean, maintained, safe, anonymous, perfect for someone who's nervous about training."
Kim Hother Nissen,4,"Great training center with many options but more machines are gradually being worn out and it is difficult to see kilos indication,more loose grip needs replacement. men's changing clothes hang slightly in the brake."
Christina Fryhstych,5,"Nice mall, good"
Per Haulund,4,"Only minus is, there are a lot of people who don't change shoes, which ultimately contributes to broken machines more expensive membership.They should have 1 warning and look like"
Lars Mathes,4,"Overall a very good centre with good quality of equipment, but the bath facilities are worn out."
Lotte,5,A center where there is room for everyone.Helpful staff.Maskins for everyone and ok with choice of teams for my consumption.Indoor climate a little dry. Very nice and clean conditions and super good dressing
Henrik Persson,4,A comparatively reasonable price for machines that unfortunately do not always meet expectations
kunde,4,"Super training (stram up) just too bad that equipment like dumbbells is so worn out so the ""foam"" is almost worn away."
Jacob Fassler,5,"Having trained all over the world, I can confidently say this gym is definitely a must. Their daily fee is incredibly fair for everything they offer, I cannot suggest this gym enough. Absolute 10/10 spot."
Virginia Hutauruk,5,"Been to 40+ gyms around the world and this is one of the best. High quality equipment and they have everything you need.

Olympic lifting, all machines, booty area, functional fitness, delicious protein shakes.

Hagen at the reception is also very friendly. Owners please open this gym in Lisbon! 😀"
OLIVER CREGENZAN ALBERTI,5,"Good location, reasonably good price for Danish standards, open 7 days a week, and super friendly staff by email and at the entrance.
Equipment not extremely new but very well kept, good space and when you join, they also offer a free coaching/personal session to guide you! 💪"
Alissa Orr,5,"Fantastic gym with tons of equipment. Plenty of options and plenty of space to move around. Lots of racks, benches, dumbbells, kettlebells, bands. Cardio equipment includes plenty of treadmills, bikes, stair climbers, etc.

Plenty of lockers available and I was offered a combo lock if needed. Affordable day pass (60 dkk) was easy to pay. There was always an employee at or near the front desk who was quick to help."
Oussama K,5,"Best gym I’ve ever went to. Very friendly staff, fully equiped with everything and a great Schwarzi painting.
Ideally located with a fair day pass for travelers. 5/5"
Amit K Mishra,5,All modern equipment are available at a reasonable subscription rate. Definitely I will join soon.
Mikkel Thygesen,3,"Good facilities, but it is in dire need of better climate control. It's only about 19c outside now but the inside the gym is burning (when doing workouts obviously). The group hall is even worse because they're not allowed to open the windows."
Christian Haugbølle,1,"Signed up and regretted my subscription within the 14 days cancellation period. I had a very, very hard time getting them to understand that I should not pay for the rest of the month + 1 month if I cancelled within 14 days (they even asked if I had actually READ their terms, which I had ... and turned out their center-leader had not, which was very awkward for her). I can't recommend Fitness World."
D Kar,5,"Huge training space. Good quality classes. Would be great for me if instructor use a little bit of English too for the people who don't speak danish.
I like fitness world."
Ivan Vlasov,1,"I checked on their website that they are open and offer one-time visit. I came, waited for 10 minutes - no administrator appeared (the client/members were there), and then I left this place."
Julie Taeko,5,"I’ve lived in San Francisco, Japan, Spain and now Copenhagen for a little bit, but this is by far the best gym I have ever been too for the cost. At this location, they have a live DJ from 4 to 8 PM on Monday evenings, and at the other location they have a live DJ at the same time on Tuesday evenings. It’s quite amazing for the price! It’s a nice thing to have as well to spice up the workout.

Plus, they have friendly staff, plenty of lockers to put away your stuff, a Zen room to do your own AI powered workout, and so many machines! Also, they have drinks and protein ice cream bars you can purchase."
Cyrus Hiatt,5,"Fantastic gym. I have been working out there for about 4 months now and enjoy the equipment, staff, and the fact that they are open 24/7. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a new gym in Copenhagen."
Mikkel Anderson,5,"Go here at night and it is like getting into a night club, great atmosphere and music is almost always on point!
There is a guy here, think he is called Rasmus, always smiling and welcoming. He gets you in a mood that forces all great energy into you and makes the lifts much better. Would highly recommend going here, and in Repeat I general!"
Alberte Schmidt Koefoed,4,"Love the interior of this gym. Much better than any other gym I have tried. They have a great selection of equipment. However, the music is sometimes really really loud and the place can get quite busy during peek hours."
eclipseNF,1,"This gym has really terrible policies for drop in, day pass people, such as tourists like myself. I went there at 3:15pm on a Saturday, and the staff member told me I couldn't train because he was leaving at 4pm, and I was not allowed to let myself out of the gym without a staff member being there, even though it's a 24 hour gym and was full of people. Very bad policy for taking care of casual people like me who really want to train."
Carlos Olivo,5,Very nice gym. I got a week pass for 110 dkk or something like that wich is really surprisingly cheap for this quality gym. You can also do daily passes. The only thing to bear in mind that after 6pm and on the weekends there is no one to check you in so come before if you want to singup and then you can use the gym using a card until midnight.
Martha V. Shelton,5,"well appointed gym; not crowded mid
morning"
Thomas Jakins,4,"Never really too busy but it is quite small. Like alot of fitness worlds it could update the machines.
Generally its very clean, its one of the better fitness worlds."
Hendrik H,1,Gym has only very limited service times. Impossible to workout after this time if you only want to workout for a day.
Sharad Govil,5,Great Gym- I was a bit nervous as this is my first time to a gym in Denmark but the front staff was very friendly and helpful. For 99DKK I could get a pass for a week. It opens from 5:30 AM to 10:00 PM. The timing showed in google is when front staff is available. You need an access card to enter so if you are first times from overseas go after 8:00 AM so staff can open the door for you.
Jon H,4,"Great gym and CrossFit lessons, I usually do drop in when I visit CPH. If you do not speak Dannish and are looking to do a drop in CrossFit avoid classes with the coach John David, he has a lack of interest and not welcoming to new members, the rest of the coaches are great.
I totally recommend this friendly gym."
Peter Hagström,5,Best crossfitbox I’ve been to so far! They got it all and is a must visit if you love Crossfit and is in town. Friendly people and great classes.
Lilya Moerk,5,Very nice gym. Good atmosphere and friendly people around!
Oskar W V,5,"Nice outside and inside gym, really nice owner, and cool New and smart equipment!"
Can Deger,5,"The best gym by far, I have seen in CPH"
J Masnec,3,"Ok gym for a chain. Slection of machines is good, slection of classes not so good. Not crowded. Highlight is the two squash terrains. Downside - you cant reserve them online if you're not a squash member. Fitness membership doesnt help, you have to have a seperate squash membership."
Isabel Monteiro,1,"Jesus Christ..
this place needs a deep cleaning !!!!  The shower is full of spiderwebs, the mats were all very wet of sweat..

Be careful at the room were they do boxing the wood floor is very slippery

Not enough  hygge but:

Friendly employees !
Cool time at the boxing class!"
Ewa Palenta-Rusin,2,"I give 1 star more than #fitnessworld actually deserves for the great ""hold"" instructors. Otherwise it is a poor service fitness center that want to rip you off at every turn. I got a special offer when I signed up because it was FW birthday - ""All-in"" free for one month. It was the end of month and I did not get to use it at all. But to my big astonishment, it was an opt-in subscription service, so I was actually billed for the next month without even being notified beforehand! I cancelled it right away but I had to pay for that month anyway. So I used it a few times. And here comes the next surprise - again I was billed for the product I ""bought"" on top of my monthly fee.
I am asking, is that what a reputable fitness chain do? I doubt.."
William Maddocks,4,"One of the better fitness worlds, nice and open, high ceilings, nice facilities.

Only thing that stopped it being 5 stars is the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom/shower areas sometimes"
Kirsten Evans,3,"Great place to work out, the Dance Fit class was really good.  But as with all FW centers a good cleaning, would be great!"
Bartosz Gałecki,3,"Air conditioning is not turned on. Instead they put a couple of fans around the gym, which just move hot air around. Not super clean but I've been to worse places. Some machines are broken for weeks without maintenance.

Good thing is that people put the weights back"
wandyr hagge,4,"Nice place for a work out. Clean. Fairly good equipments. Within the price range of other facilities. A bit under-staffed, in my opinion. Difficult to find someone to ask a question. And even If you find someone, It is not sure you will get an answer..."
Thomas Kägi,4,Visited this gym during my vacation. It has Seen better times but Its still good to get some gains:-)
Joar Torbiörnsson,1,Had my membership cancelled in the counter in proper time but still had to pay additional month.
Mikhail Nikitin,1,"One can talk about broken machines or dirt in the changing rooms, but I realize that things can't be ideal all the time. So I'd say it all goes relatively well until one needs to talk to someone beyond the helping guys in the centre. The company doesn't have a phone number to call. They have a chat, which main purpose seems to relay a message ""Fill in the online contact form"". When you do, there is a waiting time from hours to days. And if you get an answer, it never changes regardless whether you can prove them wrong or lying. They merely stop responding. And there's nothing you can say to someone who is not willing to listen."
Bas Klerk,5,"Great gym. It’s relatively small but has plenty of cables, freeweights and squat racks, so really everything you need. Very kind staff and chill atmosphere."
Nine Sofie Holmelin,5,"Amazing local gym! Feels way more personal and comfortable, than any other gyms I’ve been to."
Edi Osmani,5,"Very good gym.High quality Equipment ,very good treadmills and also boxing  fitness classes to get really fit ...friendly staff.I would really reccomend..."
Helena Söderberg,5,"I alway feel welcome to SHC 😊 Very professional staff!! Many different classes 💪😅 PT’s and trainers to choose from, who always challenge us, always are positive, and in a good mood. Easy booking system. SHC makes me feel stronger, healthier and happier 😀"
Christian Dich,1,"Was ordering a guest visit as I was considering changing to SHC. I was standing in the gym at Radisson and ringed the bell for around 10 - 15 minutes in the hours there is staffer without any service.

Would not recommend visiting when handling potential customers like that."
popov dimitar,1,"Is the busiest fitness world what i ever seen before . It’s absolutely desastre. I cannot workout normally… today i make for 1h - just 3 exercises. I recommend to nobody subscribe there . They don’t care about the occupancy… (may be we need new covid pandemy) sale and sale new memberships. Also they grow up with the price ? For what? Unfortunately I’m looking for other place with a months; just here is noone option. I hope other companies make good the marketing. Repeat: not subscribe in this gym you will sorry a lot 😪 doesn’t matter the day; weekends ; evenings or mornings all the time is full full full , no one place free to work ! You pay your money for nothing!"
Sebastian,1,"Unfortunately this gym has been severely worsened by the “upgrade” in connection with the change to PureGym.
The machines (Matrix) are really bad and it seems that there’s less equipment too.
Will not be coming back."
Wouter Roosen,4,"Really like this gym,  I just think it gets a bit dirty. They vacuum every day but that seems to be it.  A lot of equipment and different types: machines,  free weights, kettle bells, balls etc... and great space too"
Lucas C,2,"They should put more space to park the bikes, it is very busy in the afternoon and I didn't like that they made me take off my shoes when that rule is not written anywhere"
Fab Indi,5,"Very nice gym with brand new machines. Very clean, paint is all new and staff is super nice.

Price is also great."
Nicolas Wirth,3,"Medium cleanliness, too few barbell racks compared to the total area this gym covers. Could be better, could be worse. It has never been too crowded and the clientele is nice."
Tyler C,1,"They always play games with pricing. Claim it's 134,50/month, then want to charge 143,18 with no explanation of the extra fee. It's clear you simply can't trust Fitness World."
Lassana Sanogo,5,"This gym is very clean, not overcrowded and reasonably priced. Give it a try."
subnet001,3,"If you wish to pick up heavy things and put them down again in the ugliest building in town you've come to the right place. This place has it all! It's got infinite running things, stay-still-pedallers, heavy handles, pull ropes, hard-to-pick-up-if-you're-weak balls, make-your-life-difficult machines and hulahoops. All are kept well maintained and on a leash if necessary. According to rumors, there are also classes for different things but I don't know anything about that. Get the app,  it helps with stuff I've never used and looks nice.

*EDIT* I'm revoking a star for no longer being open 24 hours! I wanna lift at night! Otherwise, no change."
Bill C,5,"399 kroner for 1 month or 75 kroner for 1 day.  No commitment or long-term contract.  The gym has everything you could want, everything is new and very nice.  Staff is also very good.  Highly recommend."
Jakob Stepke,5,Great Gym for bodybuilding. Arsenal pendulum and Hacksquat. Every hammerstrength machine. And also an area with bumper plates and CrossFit style Racks. + A big posing area
"Craig Kirsner, MBA",5,This is an amazing gym! They have everything you need for a great workout. I highly recommend it!
Mark Milton,5,"Great hardcore gym with brand new equipment. Everyone there was jacked as f, huge and roided out which is always a good sign you’re at the best gym in town."
Neetu Kumari,5,Very good gym space. And good guidance for beginners as well by the receptionist. There are in house personal trainer you can hire. Not very crowded. Overall very good. 10 min walk feom Ny ellebjerg Station.
Thomas Jansson,2,"Only 2 running machines, so not a normal gym, but mostly for body builders. Tiny unheated changing room. With a membership fee of 495DKK/month this is a joke."
TheFelza,1,"I was told one thing in English, then made sign something else in Danish, so they could charge me for time I wasn't even in Denmark"
Theis Egeberg,5,"Pretty much every type of training equipment you find yourself needing. It is open 24/7 and has a nice system for entering and exiting. The place is clean and neat, and the atmoshpere is relaxed. A special plus about this center is the high ceilings making the air circulation very nice. Staff is always smiling and friendly, never felt that it was overcrowded with visitors, even at peak hours."
Roy Moukarzel,5,"One of the best places to train in Denmark. Many locations specially in Copenhagen, with good equipment."
Sqweebo1,5,"These 5 stars are for the hardworking staff who make this gym shine. If by some chance they have been laid off or furloughed due to the pandemic, please hire them all again."
Andre Harris,5,This place is really nice... has tons of machines to use and is open 24hr. Perfect if your trying to avoid the crowds.
Mark Saraira,1,"If it possible to give 0 star a will, i cancel my membership and tell the staff in the gym that i gonna move to another city, the say ok but the money for February we cannot give it to you back(i train 1 time in February), i say ok just cancel me member the say ok, now 01.03.2023 the received from my card again 239 for nothing!!, i’am in another city i cant go to the gym and they still received from my card money, stupid rules and the manager who say to me in February you will not pay anymore is lier. I will never ever update my membership again in your gym, (take my money for nothing)."
Angi Las,1,"The Studio is not in best Shape. As Many before me wrote: it’s very small, the devices are packed!! Could be a lot cleaner - especially the toilets.
But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.
Will go to another fitness world studio in the future and hope that the next one will be more modern and clean und the staff maybe a little more educated."
Daniel Storm,2,"Watch out! In the mens changing rooms there are someone unscrewing the locks so they can open the lockers even if you have your own lock on.

This has been a big problem over the last year. And Fitness World do not inform you about this!!!!"
Eduardo Simões,1,"Attention! I have noticed some screws missing in the locks of the locker room (males). This allows the door to be opened even with a lock. Always choose a locker with screws as the screws cannot be removed with a lock on. Also, booking system is problematic."
Navid Mosadeghi,5,It’s clean and well equipped.
Matthew Horner,5,"Amazing gym very large with everything you could possibly need! A seperate section for each body part I.e. legs, chest etc. Also includes a sauna and showers but never used it but from what I saw looks great!"
donny,1,"This gym has seen better days. Devices are old, often broken or make squeaking noises. Steam sauna closed down permanently. Regular sauna and showers are broken since weeks. Not worth the high fees. You find better gyms in Copenhagen for half of the price."
Dan Leonhardt,2,"Wasted potential. This could be a good gym, but their obvious desire to minimize spending really hurts the customer experience.

Equipment is broken for weeks (sometimes months) at a time. Showers work intermittently, and when down, also take weeks to fix.

Locker room has lots of almost all half size lockers (many of which are broken) and these are only half occupied even at peak times. So why not install a room of full length lockers and keep them in working order? That would cost money. Can't do that it would seem.

There was a steam room. It was closed in early 2022, supposedly due to high energy prices at the time. Never reopened. No reason given, other then the ridiculous argument that somehow, by keeping it open, the whole business would fail and the gym would then have to close down.

And the minimal staffing means there's nobody to enforce the rules (CLEAN THE MACHINE WHEN YOU ARE DONE!) or do little things like fill up soap dispensers in the bathrooms and showers."
Joshua Formentera,4,An excellent location Gym few minutes walk to the main city street. The gym is located in the ground level and has complete running facilities and gym equipment for power lifting and bodybuilding.
Boris Sipkovsky,3,Good gym with everything you can think of. Equipment nearing a need of refresh and staff nowhere to be found. But can do proper training here
Krisztián Lehotzky,5,I really enjoyed running and exercise here in this beautiful environment with the lake.
Mykolas Rainys,3,Gym for kids.
Ulla Mo Andersen,5,Very cool after the walk with outdoor training
Leander Sørensen (LENR),5,"3 small training sites. Fine.
Nothing worth seeing."
Lotte Chili Franijeur,5,"Super cool training, skilled physiotherapist and good atmosphere 💪"
Henar Luque,4,"Super convenient place as it is in the middle of Nørrebro. The place is a little rusty but it has all needed for exercising and more. Also Arca has many different places all around the city so if you are thinking about starting to do some exercises and taking care of your health, I recommend you to check it out. Trainers are nice and well versed and will guide you through each exercise and movement. Also, they often can take the class in English if you ask. Good fitness journey."
gabriela geneyro,1,"Be careful with the membership disclaimer, they like to take advantage and collect money scamming you. I didn't use the facilities for 6 months because of health issues [among other things], and they  sent me a letter and charged me KR 1,109. Horrible experience for me, they lost a customer for ever."
Ievgeniia,1,"Some instructors should be trained better on how to react in case person gets an injury in class. I had an overall good experience with CrossFit Copenhagen, but one unqualified teacher with unprofessional behavior made me change my mind.
Basics should be obvious - if someone at your class gets heavily injured, you need to take care of them and help, not just ask them leave immediately."
Diane Lee,1,"Outrageous company. Complete absence of professionalism or customer service. ALL of my classes got cancelled last month for some unknown reason, and Crossfit CPH refused to refund me for the membership. This kind of ""Just deal with it - we don't care about you"" attitude from them, is incredibly annoying. I will cancel my membership as soon as I can."
Shameer Kustagi,1,"Same here, I had registered too and cancelled on time but they charged 300 dkk for no reason and there is no number to call them either - how is that possible and makes me wonder which century are we living in? All big talks and show off! zero professionalism."
Pernille O.,5,"Great gym, they also have physical therapy (how I know this place) and what ever workout you like. They have a tons of classes from yoga, spinning, crossfit, pilates, TRX, dance and all the machines you would want in a gym. They have big changing rooms and showers and lockers. All the personal I have met so far were super friendly. They have competitive prices."
Fisun Eriksen,5,"Favorite gym. Machines and the fitness program is very good, there is a classy boutique fitness atmosphere . The members are also better than many other fitness clubs I tried. I have been member of the place for nearly four years and visit minimum five times a week 😉💪"
Lena Hammes,5,High quality physiotherapeutic treatment and very well organized. I can only recommend Fysisk Form in Vesterbro. I was treated by Camilla Hofman Hansen and was very happy! Super professional aswell as caring for the person.
sikander Shah,5,"Great,cosy gym catering to all ages and has its own physio clinic with top professional therapists."
søren borring,5,"Relaxed atmosphere, with no heavy weight lifting"

Phai Dip,5,Barry’s bootcamp is quite simply the best workout in the world. Another great atmosphere branch with staff that really looks like they’re enjoying themselves. Highly recommend.
Paul Dariye,5,"Werk it! Imagine a gym in a club or a club with a gym with some of the prettiest people who also happen to be easygoing and approachable. That’s Barry’s!

I had fun, I enjoyed some good tunes, and I got a workout."
Amy Eldridge,5,"Visited from my home studio(s) in Houston and Washington, D.C.  It's always a great workout!"
Angela Eva A.,5,"If you like to get Energy into your bloodstream, that’s the place to go. ☀️
The personnel is also very nice and helpful 👍"
Lewis Atkins,2,"Just a very bad gym. Staff don’t really care, don’t blame them tbh it’s miserable in here. All-in deal is bad value. Lots of equipment but the space is pretty sad and windowless"
Rune Perstrup,1,"An Unhygienic Coronavirus Petri Dish.

I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously."
Mario Piazza,1,"In a huge gym there is only one hair dryer and it’s not working. I asked the staff to fix it one week ago and they told me they will replace it immediately. Today still the same problem and it’s even dangerous as the wire is open. I told the staff guy that I suffered from sinusitis and have to blow my long hair. I even asked him to give me the one in the women’s changing room for few minutes. He said the hair dryer is fixed. When I asked him how is it possible that in such a huge gym there is no other hair dryer, he told me that they didn’t bring the new hair dryer yet and there is no other one. Unacceptable."
Emil Lassen,5,"It's a great gym with basically everything you could want or need, there is access to lockers both in the dressing rooms and when you enter the center. You enter using a card or bracelet, which is great since it's open 24/7. The only bad thing is that some of the members, don't put their plates and dumbbells back where they belong."
Frank Ejby Poulsen,3,"The gym is great, spacious and has everything, and the personel is friendly and helpful.

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded."
Joonas Toivonen,4,"Good gym at a great location. Friendly staff. Unfortunately Danes do not know gym etiquette: all weights are left on barbells. That's a big minus, but not fully FitnessDK's fault."
Arise Christensen-Cordes,2,"Great staff! Helpful and friendly!
But the center itself feels rusty and old compared to SATS on nørrebro."
Leigh Brocklehurst,4,"Great friendly, helpful  staff. Spacious training areas…Air conditioning would be nice in summer !!!"
Natalia,2,Why do you have so few group classes comparing to other Sats places? Its unfair
Mattias Fjellström,4,Pretty large gym. Large section for CrossFit-type training and even larger section with machines.
sezen dandinoğlu,5,"I was looking for a sports club in Copenhagen for boxing. Then I found SHC Scandinavia. I take Muay Thai and boxing classes here. I have never practiced Muay Thai before. You can also start from scratch. You are in good hands ;)
SHC personnels are professional. The trainers care about you and all members during the class, explain every movement, and give feedback at that moment. There is no language barrier, we communicate in English. Changing rooms are clean. They pay attention to the hygiene of the environment and the commonly used equipment.
I recommend SHC Scandinavia for those who are looking for a different option. Before the membership go and visit them. They will answer all of your questions :)"
Jacob Barreth,5,"Best gym around. Great features, good locations and the best staff"
Sam Nasif,2,"Located inside radisson blu hotel. The gym is clean and specious, it’s more suitable for functional training than weightlifting although it has dumbbells rack and a couple of cable machines. Personal trainers are very common there and they can be powerful that they hang on to multiple machines at once for their trainees without giving a timeframe when they will let go of one of the machines with the “I’m still using it” attitude. So better hire a trainer or you’ll end up doing cardio only."
XoloTravel XT,5,"very nice place
one of my best gym/fitness center"
redyy,5,Mm

The community is strong and you will find like minded people who are dedicated to what they do.

Highly recommended :)"
Marc Alvado,5,"Good facility, perfect equipement if you are into boxing / thaï boxing and/or crossfit. No bodybuilders looking at their reflection in the mirror here. Atmosphear between members is very friendly."
Mikkel Rask,4,"Edit: You have to take less than 6 years to reply on a review, to earn the last one."
Jonas Meier Uldall,5,"Very nice high end gym. I have been going there for about 6 months.
It is never too crowded and very talented coaches are always willing to help."
Karolis Dumbrovas,2,"Its not a gym, its an underground (literally) box with just a few machines. Especially lacking of ventilation (during the corona times you dont want that), and rather small. Although it felt cozy and the receptionist was really nice."
Saxoboy,4,"Big but cosy gymnasium, also used for music lessons."
Duc Hl,5,"So amazing, many talent young people"

Charlotte Krogh,1,"Worst High School in Denmark. If not in the whole world. Don't let your kids go there. Unprofessional teachers and principal who do not take the students seriously when they come with an inquiry and problem. Teachers kept their distance when they knew the student was not vaccinated and made inappropriate and unnecessary comments. Students are treated differently and differently based on their race and ethnicity. Teachers who could come up with comments
and statements such as ""You can run me to Christmas"" and ""I hope you don't come to the exam, because then you will all fail"". This high school goes to great lengths to present itself as ""competent citizens"", but this is not the case at all. On the contrary. This high school is the reason why many previous students have not been able to study their dream education, as they give unfair grades WITHOUT making arguments for the applicable grade. The teachers at this high school tend to ask the students to appear interested and nice ""what education do you want to pursue in your near future"" so they can be sure to destroy your dream with unfair grades and feedback."
Eric Walter,5,"They sell really good capri sonnes and the teachers seem very nice, regards eric walter ceo"
David Stig Wülser,5,Very cool high school!
Mohammad Kazem,5,
Búi Helgason,1,"Way too gravy.
Phew!
Bad and nonsensical teachers who don't even get to know the material.
Better not go here."
Default Strafezzz,1,I have experienced exactly the same as Eskild Wagner.
Elias Lunøe,5,"I've had three fantastic years at this high school. Steen and Sami are probably the best teachers in Denmark, so try to get them."
Eskild Wagner,1,I was pushed into the blackboard by my biology teacher because I thought micro-organisms were what you got when you sneezed
Johan Sejersbøl,5,The neighbors seem really nice and nice
李梨,3,"Aaaaa Who can tell me how to enter the Gym at 6pm? I signed up a Pliates course, but I can’t find the entrance. The doors was closed."
Mr Toast,1,Worst place to take a education. The teachers don’t care about you and won’t try to help you. The management will try find anything on you so that they can remove you. Racist teachers had one tell me “I’m gonna place my bag here hopefully you don’t steal it” as the only person with color in the class that was not funny to experience. The class did not even find the comment funny so it had to be a bad comment with bad intent.
Bianca Rasmussen,5,Ørestad High School is a beautiful modern building with its signature staircase connecting the students together on all floors.
Janaka Neranjan,3,High school

Big Wasabi,5,"I went to DFG when it was located in Birkerød. At the time, it received half of the government's subsidy. I don't know how it works today. What was so important about my time at DFG was that I became skilled at thinking independently and learning to make rational, intelligent decisions. I also learned a lot about respecting other culture and a lot about history and other important things. I'm sure the school is just as good nowadays. I had good teachers and am happy with my 3 years at this completely unique school with a progressive form of education."
Magdalena Pressler,5,❤️
Viktor El poderoso,5,a super nice school! cheers cheers

'Education', as in respect for other people, is an important virtue that allows us to rise above the mediocre and set standards that are vital for a sustainable life and society. We focus on traditional Christian values, including character building, because belief in one's own abilities, perseverance and personal discipline are keys to utilizing one's full potential."
Petrine Fjeldal,5,A school where the social presence among friends and teachers becomes a lot easier and more fun.
Gunner Binderup,5,Warm and caring. Inclusive and accepting community.

Simon Kristensen,4,"Good teachers, good students and good premises. They can also deliver a nice party and cool tours. If you live nearby it should also be an obvious choice, especially due to its small size. However, I live a bit away, which drags it down a bit."
Luna Simone,3,"its fine, the projects do not work, however, many of the premises. most teachers are nice, but there are a few who are not."
Jakob Sandfort,5,"Good choice of high school if you are looking for friends with the same ""nerdy"" interests. Committed teacher and a fantastic atmosphere"

Johannes Langen,5,I have done an internship where it is really good
nodirghat,4,Nice
Anders Olesen,1,Bad management who don't care about well-being. The study counselors don't do much
Mimi Holm,4,"I took my student exam here many years ago. Back then we learned how to square dance for the traditional annual party. We also performed the Odyssey. Was on stage with the now well-known actor Søren Pilmark. Even then, it was his goal to become an actor. It was an exciting few years with our physics teacher, who most of all reminded me of doc Emmett Brown from the movie Back to the Future."
Nikolai Tofte Olesen,5,They have made a very good song.
Hiyam Hussein,5,nice school
nodirghat,4,School
Sjune _,5,"Despite the fact that the school is a dry biscuit to look at, it is quite cool😎 There are several rooms, check! Cozy atmosphere, certified playful teachers, and a boss school choir💂‍♀️
But seriously, more hamburgers😒
Shouts out to the 2 board members, you are also the boss.
Now you're probably thinking, wow, you're probably biased. To that I answer… yes. Here is pretty good📝🩼👨🏽‍🌾🤪🤖🐟🦗"
Twinkie,2,I tried to see what it could do. And it couldn't.
Adam Badawey,5,"Wallah I live there, really good it 11 out of 10"
Cowpoke Balga,1,People are whack and not enough hamburgers are sold since half the school is vegan
Daniii,5,Nice
Mr. Emin,5,"Good school, with many different students, and there is a canteen, the prices are a bit bad but fine enough, there is a cinema and computers, etc."
Melvin Bidstrup,5,Really cool establishment and a generally good experience in the building with lots of history
Cupids Heaven,1,"This place is garbage.

It doesn't really matter which field of study you choose, as you will most likely never work with it in high school.

I don't know who makes the charts, but I sincerely hope they never have children so that their indifferent, pathetic bloodline stops here.

Very few of the teachers here are good. Most are constantly late for their own classes, and some of them are generally just terrible at their work (learning from themselves).

I hate this place with all my heart."
Bullowich,1,if there are problems at school you get a conversation with the study counselor in a not so nice tone which then ends with total ignoring where they hope they can get you to stop. has happened to several….
Anton Birch,5,"who asked Bob, step back to your mother's basement"
Finn Pehrson,5,Overwhelming emotions when handing over diplomas.
Bob Marley,2,Cannot be recommended. Low level.
Josias Holm,1,
Nick Jørgensen,5,
Gianmario Piras,2,"I give this gym 2 stars because it is not worth what it costs for me. It should be a better level than many others that cost half but, there aren't many courses available, in fact they are few, the cardio machines half have been broken for months. In the changing rooms there is always a lack of paper and soap in the showers. For 449 kr I don’t even have a drink included, if it weren't for it being close to my house I would definitely go back I wouldn't stay. At least the music it’s really good, and the staff is kind. 😊"
Julie Taeko,5,"Absolutely love this gym, as it has a wonderful music playing at all times, and a live DJ on Tuesday evenings from 4 to 8 PM. They offer a few classes, and these gym-goers are very motivated people. So it makes you feel like you should work harder, and overall, I get a fantastic workout done! Also, this location has 2 floors."
David O. Andersen,5,"Loungey gym with a unique atmosphere. Two floors of weight and machines, live DJ at peak hours, open 24 hrs."
Tails Hon1nbo,5,"Was a Simple sign up for my relatively short visit (few weeks), even as an American that doesn't speak any Danish. The late night access was automated and worked pretty well"
Marina Orenga Sànchez,5,Really nice club with loads of equipment
Aleksandar Maricak,3,Relative okay gym. Matrix machines are not the best and the Nautilus were better before renovation. Dumbbells are not put in the correct location and it is always overcrowded. Not enough machines compared to the demand.
Type One Fitness,1,They changed the cost of a guest fee from 50kr to 69kr and the new Matrix equipment is so so so uncomfortable. Since PureGym took over this place it is easily the worst gym in Østerbro!
Ẹniọlá,4,"Go-to location.
Very spacious and always clean.
Staff are nice and helpful.
And overall atmosphere is very easy going yet focused and motivating :)

Check it out yourself though"
KlippeG,2,"Nice location, but very small center compared to how many people train there. You have to be lucky sometimes to get a treadmill. It has been a chronic problem since I started there last summer that many treadmills do not work, and unfortunately it is only getting worse. Has a good area in the basement for stretching"
Arthur Golshani,5,"Top gym ! Top équipement, ideal for foreigners as it is possible to get daily / weekly pass."
Huttan T. L,1,"As someone who have been in all FW's in Copenhagen, this place is by far the most horrid. Rude staff who seems like they hate their life. They lack a total grasp on how to give service (Talking ESPECIALLY the female ones). There is also ZERO atmosphere and place is very dirty and STINKS  utterly on each of its three (Small) floors . Just find another place than this, because this place is so outrageously bad it drains you from all motivation. Not exaggerating."
Mathias Moslund,5,Good gym!
Lisa Apers,3,"Okay, it would however be really nice to have an indicator somewhere of how crowded it is. Also sometimes they play the music really loud (so loud that with headphones with noise cancelling even at the highest volume I can still hear it). Not even mentioning the music taste 😶."
Krzysztof Turczyn,4,"This place is great!
They have all you need and they're open 24 hours, if it was even a bit dirty it's because lazy members do not know how to behave! People working there are trainers and office staff they are not your slave and they are not there to clean you mess! But there is one thing that drives me crazy and I was trying to ignore it but it is a bit hard now... the music when the staff leaves. If any staff employee of FW is reading it, can you PLEASE contact the staff in this gym and asked them to when they leave at 8 PM maybe set some radio or some motivational music? There was this one day that the song got stuck it was play allllllllllll night long, the same one song, and it was not even a good one, and literally after 40 mins I left coz not even my headphones helped. And yesterday there was some country music. In general after 8 there is always ""not the best music"" and I think if it's like this I'd prefer to work out in silence.
But otherwise as I mentioned great place."
Anton Nikolov,4,"The fitness center has been improved in the last months. Still no classes though. Otherwise, it has all the needed facilities for full body training. Third floor is the best one! Free weights! :)"
Geraint Nott,2,"A lot of young people go to this gym, and don't appreciate or follow gym etiquette. Often leaving weights where they use them, don't clean the machines after use and often sit for a long time looking at their phones. The gym is not staffed all the time and so no one tells these children to clean up after themselves.

Otherwise the gym is fine with modern and working machines. It can be a little cramped in some areas where the free weights are used, but this wouldn't be a problem if people were not so entitled and treated it like their personal gym."
Mike Martins,1,"The average age of the members in this gym must be somewhere around 17/18 at the most. Its pretty close to a folkeskole, hence you'll find alot of kids and teenagers in this gym.They come in large groups and take all the space (in an already very small gym) by basically playing around, acting like they're at a playground.

Other than that, the gym is very dirty and messy (This is also due to most of these teenagers neither sanitizing/cleaning up after themselves) and the music is too loud as well as being very poorly choiced songs."
Stephen Kaplan,5,"Not large, but never really crowded. The most spotless fitness club I've been to.... They are constantly cleaning and members take care of the equipment also."
N H,4,"Good place, fun courses. However, some of the info is hard to access, as most of it is in Danish only. Sometimes courses get cancelled, and I do not receive a message about it, although I have signed up."
Stefan Müller,5,"Good fitness center with weekly memberships, perfect as a tourist. Many Courses and access to every center they have (and they have many in Copenhagen)."
Ahmad Kasem Haidar,3,"Englandsvej, It's good and I enjoy training there with different machines BUT I didn't give 5 stars because we have to refill our water bottles from the toilet sink!
Hope they will make a separate place for water."
Sebastian,1,"Yet another Fitness World center, which have been worsened by the PureGym-makeover.
Strenght training has been compressed into too little space and instead they added a lot of useless cardio equipment for amateurs. It’s becoming more and more clear that the latter is the clientele which PureGyms wants to cater to - not us, who consistently go to the gym +5 times a week.
It’s such a pity with this systematic destruction of the relatively few good gyms we have."
horia cunea,5,"Great place and great staff, also Victor was very helpful ans answered all my questions very nice"
Mikhail Nikitin,4,"After renovation they made an ""open office"" environment in the changing room. Bizarre. And still no soap or shampoo in the shower."
Jennifer C,5,"Excellent gym. Many locations, good value for money, friendly staff, well equiped and huge variety of classes."
Tomas Sharky,5,"I think it's a great gym in regards to value price. Unfortunately there is no many branches. The gym is quite well equipped even with small basketball court, punch bag and paper towels. The whole gym has the urban vibe. I think it's good alternative to the well known ones in Denmark. The air ventilation does not seem to work properly, though."
Gregor Haeusler,2,"One star just for the nice location. The service ended his shift 10mins early and completely ignored me and another costumer waiting on the counter. The machines are mostly so old, they must be from the 90s. Not recommendable."
RUECKENWIND,1,"I'm shocked after reading reviews that are just 3 years old (urban gym) compared to today. Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

The only good thing are the other people, most of them are friendly. The gym itself is just disgusting and not worth the money. That's just the review for that certain location."
Diego Alonso,3,Quite small. The free workout area is quite large
Andrei Grigorian,4,"Great gym for the price and accessibility. Very well cleaned and maintained with all the equipment you would ever need. Large free training area, kettlebells, plenty of barbells and plates."
TheFelza,1,"I was told one thing in English, then made sign something else in Danish, so they could charge me for time I wasn't even in Denmark"
Noah P,5,Great gym. 7 day free pass was available for traveling
Ricardo López,1,"Terrible.

They changes my membership 2 times without me telling to do so.
First time i has to pay a supplement of 100 dkk because a mistake of one of the brilliant guys working there.

Second time they set my main gym elsewhere, so today i had to pay 30dkk extra to go to the gym i usually go.

On top of that, the first mess they did was not fixed. It is impressive how Fitness World hire the brightest minds in Denmark."
Meritxell Fernández,5,Best FW center I have been too. Really clean and functional. The equipment is new and everything is in one floor. The only cons are the lack of hold classes.
Aditya Sachdev,4,Great place quiet a lot of space and all equipments are present.
Jakub Hupka,2,Please fix the gymnastic rings 🙏🙏 Otherwise decent gym.
Juan De Marzi,1,Weeks like this.
P-A M.,3,"I've worked out in three different gyms in Copenhagen and this one was clearly the worst. There aren't enough showers in the men's locker rooms and they are incredibly wastefull in water. Another low point is the door system letting you in the gym, which keeps denying you the entrance if you're not perfectly positioned inside the cabin - too much fuss for nothing. Also, there are many annoying teenagers that aren't there for serious training, they're loud and using the equipment for fun while other people want to go on with their workout.

Otherwise the amenities for the workout per se are good and various."
Jonas Vilkevicius,1,"Service has improved for the last 6 months, better management. However the audience that comes there is poor,  people are aggressive, taken several machines at once,  or sitting on one machine for ages prohibiting others from training, noisy, have no respect to others, often screaming . Needs some education on general public as many have no intelligence how to behave"
David Berger,4,"I’ve been a member for 3 months, and I’ve got to say the new management is doing a great job. Clean, open and welcoming. Not too many machines, but plenty of room for circuit training.

CrossFit, cardio, stretching, body weight, running, free weights, and machines."
Yousef Elnono,1,Some of their machines are old and in need of maintenance. Their treadmills are in really bad state but as you can see on the picture a technician is on the way. Months and months has passed and no sign of this technician. If you tell the staff in the center or contact then on email they will say that the they have escalated this issue but the fact is the management don’t care. It will soon be a year with no repairs being made…
Stefano Rosciano,1,"I'm foreigner and what I perceived from this gym it was:

Some of the staffs are incredible unprofessional.

Employees must be trained on which are the rules and procedures.

P.s. a bit of politeness would be appreciated

Thank you,

Steve"
Anthon Anthoniussen,2,Not the best I have been at but need some more times at the Gym before evaluating
Muhammad Naveed Anjum,4,Good
Zilong Liu,5,Few people，just do yourself and feel cozy……
Diala Géo,4,"Fitness world interesting sports club  there is a variety of sports equipment, the staff are nice, you have to avoid peak hours because there is a queue for training, the problem that I found  there aren't all the information about roles of subscription, for example when you want to take a vacation you can freeze the month, or also if you want to unsubscribe this month you have to pay another month and it was the surprise for my case and all this information is not clear at the beginning. in my opinion it better that they give notes about all the ruls and the options with 2 languages Danish and English for be Easy for all people or put it on the wall in the reception"
Rastislav Pitek,1,"I cannot comprehend how anyone could open a gym of this size without thinking about any ventilation or air conditioning whatsoever. Its humid, smelly, unpleasantly hot and always crowded… Not to mention that the distribution and number of equipment is terrible… Say good bye to bench press - you wont be able to find empty bench for you.
(But the staff is nice and kind)"
A. Sam,1,"Terrible customer service! I once been there as a guest to a class under a friend’s membership (+1 guest). I have never had a membership there and has never signed up for one, yet I have been receiving emails to pay 4 months with interest for late payment?! - and then they started sending me new emails on my e-Boks. Since when I have given you a consent to do so?? Every time I stop by the gym to raise this, there’s no one to ask. and there is no number associated with the gym to call!"
Patrik Belanyi,3,"3,5*
Good location, close to metro station.
Employees are nice and helpful.
Gym is usually clean but very small and you spend some time just waiting for machines.
Recommend to check favourite times so you can avoid busy hours.

Ventilation is probably not existing and there are so many people who don’t follow gym’s rules.
The price (319dkk) is not matching to what you get."
Max Christensen,1,"STAY AWAY!!!
They got ALL my contact informations wrong. So I had no real way of paying my monthly subscription, be course I could not log in. HAhaha. Then they went all RKI on me. Agressive bunch.
I ended up just quitting, paying the bill and moving to a better gym that's more organized."
guillaume deschamps,5,"newly renovated gym, with new and fresh equipment. the place is packed on evening, and perhaps because this is the best gym for the monthly fee in the area. Highly recommend"
Mihály Baki,5,"A decent gym. Huge, many machines of the same type, good condition."
Viktória L.,5,One of the largest gyms I have ever seen with all the machines you can imagine and the staff are really nice and helpful. Never had a problem with cleanliness! Wide variety of classes are available.
David D,1,You managed to destroy what was a decent gym with a lot of equipment. It got transformed into a walking area with machines for old people and empty space. Embarrassing!
Mikhail Nikitin,4,Still no soap in the shower. And the pins for hanging up the towels are almost all broken.
Anna Maria Kyritsaki,3,"It is an okay gym, some of the equipment are not working (like some of the treadmills), it has a decent variety of machines, there is some (limited) space for free weights and it does *not* offer classes.

Stuff is friendly, options of memberships are very limited. For example, you can't work out without starting a binding contract that states that when you stop the membership you'll have to pay the current + the next month. That's pretty strange as in another branch I could just pay for a week of use without any strings attached.

Other than that, you can surely do your workout here but it doesn't compare to other more central/maybe more expensive gyms."
Jakob Guldberg Aaes,3,"Well it's there, pretty messy and the equipment has seen better days"
Ruman Mohammed (rumii),5,"Best every, the location is perfect."
Marian Andrei Iurcan XPREX,5,Great
Avni Hasani,2,"Okay gym, but lacking in many areas. Puregym on nørre voldgade fredericia has a lack of old and defective machines, a lack of cleaning and hand soap and the machine for all in is never filled. It is not acceptable with the 399 it costs for my type of abb"
Kristoff Green,4,Good place with proper equipment but horrible ventilation 😅 not good for summer 😅 but you can get to see nice views
Bence Nagy,4,"It's okay, has its variety but could use 1-2 more machines"
Oliver Bastholm,4,"Big with most facilities, but almost always very crowded."
Hicham JOHRA,5,Amazing place !!!
Mia Wulff,2,"Don't spend time or effort giving them constructive criticism even if they ask for clarification on the bad review of the center in their app because they are not willing to improve anything even though they claim they will do everything to improve. They just want to use long emails to basically say ""That's just how it is""... Not one of them I would train in permanently as they are pretty bad machines compared to other centers... There are others in Aalborg that are far better.."
Dimitar Bikov,1,Ever since it became Pure gym they removed all the hand sanitizer. Disgusting place
YZ L,5,"Best gym in Aalborg city center!!! I have been training in this gym 5 times per week since 2015. Compare to other fitness world gym in Aalborg city center, this one is THE BEST. Always clean everywhere - machines, bathrooms, and even the training mat! Offers a lot of equipments, and many different training classes you can choose."
Gustas Jucaitis,4,"Nice place, but can be quite crowded at times leading to extended waiting for the machine that you wish to use. The equipment itself is all good though."
Christian Segg,3,"Small for all the machines they’ve put in there. Smell of sweat due to bad AC.
Friendly staff though, and clean facilities.
Can be very crowded during holidays and weekends."
Frii,5,"Amazing gym, and most lovely staff ever!"
Carlo Bronold,4,"Have been coming here for 4-5 years. All around good gym, isn’t ever too packed, has a good amount of specifically the machines/equipment that is in high demand such as squat racks, benches, pulldown machines etc. but no fancy stuff, only “essential” standard equipment. Prices are also good for beginners but I think a little high if you’ve been training here for a while and there are no beginner benefits left."
Inna Bortnik,1,Don’t like it at all. People who work there is never there.
Gary Decsei,5,"Been a memeber for 6 years. Great gym with a large space, not fully packed with all sorts of machines, but there are still enough machines. Really love it. The music is quiet too, though it could be a bit lowered on Sundays. Still, a great palce, love coming here :)"
P Gh,1,"Despite having good machines and lovely physical space, the staff and customer service is unappealing. If you dont speak Danish, it is probable to get overcharged by mistake because some of the staff are not well-trained with the system besides having language barrier. I paid fee for extra months while my membership was supposedly on pause. They sent me bills without even sending me a notification about reactivation beforehand. At the end of the complicated way through the customer service, the result was: ""I understand you but sorry we cant do anything, you have to pay the money"". Yeah, this is sad to pay fee for months when you could have attended the gym but you were unaware.
That was by far my poorest experience of customer service in Denmark."
Yana Maksimova,4,"I train there. Not long ago they changed their machines which seem to be with less quality than the older ones.
If you want to train after work be aware that the place can be crowded. It is on convenient spot but due to that it can be also hard to finish your training on time.
It is clean and you can always clean the machines before and after usage."
matteo,5,Great for the daily grind this or another fitness world workes wonders
Przemysław Bronowicki,5,Everything I need !!! Thx
Mia Wulff,3,"Overall good center with proportionally good amount of machines compared to popularity. However, there is no hip thrust bench and only high benches, which means I have to go to another center for that exercise. dB is somewhat heavier than the other centers and the jumps between each weight are incredibly large at 2-3 kg. per steps. Bathing facilities could be better located. Nice and clean center which appears clearly. Lots of water points."
Jonna Kiis,5,Good facilities and good energy from the movers.
Ole sørensen,5,always clean and attractive premises
Roshni Chakraborty,5,This is one of the best centrres of Fitness world in Aalborg on the basis of the size and equipments
G. S.,5,"This is from PureGym on Gugvej and Friis in Aalborg. They are some good and spacious centers with a lot of machines, so you don't feel like you are stalling during your training. On Gugvej there is good parking! Nice places.🤗"
Mads Carlsen,4,"There are sometimes problems with groups of teenage boys who make noise, come in casual clothes, and are not there to train but to socialize and film videos for social media.

In addition, it is a center that is not too overcrowded, and has an OK amount of equipment for such a small center, and the surroundings are not too noisy as the premises are spread out."
Finn Thoft Jensen,3,"The training and the facilities are ok, but the last two times I've been there there has been a lack of toilet paper and/or paper towels in the men's changing room. The cleaning has not been ok either."
Mr. Riis,5,Can't find a better place
Oliver Bastholm,4,"A good, big center, with almost everything you could need."
Anita Hummelshøj Mikkelsen,5,Good service. Versatile options for training. Good mood. Room for everyone.
Oskar Korsgaard,3,"Super good service, but I think there are too few bench press racks and too few toilets, this may well cause a lot of waiting time, there could also be more water dispensers around, with this the prices also start to become too high, otherwise a fine training place."
Tobias Aarup,4,Too little space when it is busy and not enough machines. But otherwise I think there is a nice variety and the machines are in good condition
Christian Jensen,1,"Bad parking conditions. Had to stop at Lidl and when I got to the center the door was locked - Normally it's not a problem, but this center apparently requires a special chip in the card that can only be obtained during opening hours. This was not stated on the website!"
Chris Bateman,5,"Paid for a single session whilst on holiday. Was 49kr for a single or I think 100-109kr for a week.

Well equipped and big gym with friendly staff."
María Victoria Elola,5,I really like training here. Everything is clean and in good conditions. The equipment is great; there are many options. The staff is very friendly and always makes you feel comfortable.
Ivan Penchev,3,"Small and exclusive gym, One of the thing that pissed me most about it was that I wanted to use just the gym, which in all other gym from the Fitness world franchise cost 150 DKK, however this is not permitted and they require you to make a full membership for their gym and classes, even if you dont want to visit any of them, which is 250 DKK. As i said exclusive."
Zaul Tooz,4,"Good center for training, one of the original centers in Aalborg."
Zeynel Gazi,5,"This is the best fitnes. First it's close to me, second it is very big."
Afshin Loghmani M Toussi,3,"Very friendly staff.
It's one of the most expensive fitness world's centers in whole Denmark, but it's one of the most under equipped ones. You can find more equipment in lots of other cheaper centers and also the devices in this center already present in this one, either have less features or unadjusted, such as the treadmills, the scale and the rowing machines."
lleeoonn119,5,Very fine place
samira najafi,4,It's good with less variety of equipments.
Anne-Sophie Metais,5,They are trying to kill you! I guess that is the point..? :)
Thomas Farsakoglou,5,A really spacious and organized gym
mayquelin herrera,5,Very nice gym…. Clean and well equipped…
Reza Naeemabadi,4,You can find several training equipment for chest and shoulders in the first floor
Mughun Dev,4,A decent place to workout 👌🏼
Chris Højland,5,24 hour open
Ken Ejstrup,4,Nice place😉
Vera K,4,"I really enjoy Fitness World on Jens Baggesens vej. They have the best choice of training classes in Aarhus to my knowledge. I live in Tilst, but the Fitness World there basically has no classes at all.. maybe a handful spread over the week and often mornings.
So it is definitely worth driving to this other Fitness World with lots of evening classes and friendly staff.

The only thing is that in summer it can get very hot inside and the air is thick. So the ventilation can't keep up with the amount of people training."
Mikołaj “Złączka” Chomacki,5,They say biggest gym in scandinavia. This place is really cool! People are lovely. Can bit crowded in aftetnoons
Mika Summanen,5,Amazing cardio classes with great atmosphere!
Thai Hiep Bui,1,"Quantity over quality, very over rated, expensive. Poor cleaning and poorly organized both from the customers and the employees. Dumbbells lying everywhere, weight bars every where on the floor, racks missing dumbbells for days is a normal thing. So many machines that are so close to each other it is impossible to move around without hitting something by accident. Not very friendly staff."
Daran Young,5,Fantastic place to stay fit!
Lenka Švidrnochová,5,"Amazing gym with two floors, therefore enough space for everyone. Highly recommended for trainings in the heart of Aarhus."
suverenia,1,"Very expensive place considering that the sauna and steam bath never work properly. If the sauna is not down, then the steambath is down, and it takes months for them to fix. The steambath has currently been down for 2-3 months, and before the steambath broke down, the sauna was down for an equally long time. Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while. The bench is bent and unstable, and the walls of the sauna are getting ripped apart. And noone gives a damn.

This fitness chain took down fitnessdk and turned it into utter garbage."
John Muller,5,Excellent gym that's just recently been revamped. Has everything including full machine setups and free weights. Spacious and has a nice dressing room and sauna. Conveniently located right in the middle of town.
Jonas Elm,5,One of the best Fitness Worlds I have been in. It has a good selection of all the gear you need. Not too crowded in the morning and a major plus is that there is a sauna and a steam bath.
sachin kamble,5,Among all the centers in Aarhus. This particular center has the sauna facility. New and well designed. Can be too much crowded after 15:00 until 20:00
Luciano Andres Gino Canton Marval,1,"The balance at the gym have been broken for months, I have been waiting to weight myself and see how fat I am atm for too long"
Klemens Askjaer,4,"Has everything there needs to be at a gym but there is a bit crowded sometimes so you might have to wait in line for some things, but it's rare. Overall great gym"
Ave Nurmeots,5,One of my go-to fitness world centres in Aarhus. Lots of options and lots of space.
Exotic Lump,1,Predatory payment practices
Stinne Plesner,2,"The equipment is so worn out, the cable machines squeak and bind and there is only one lat pulldown machine. The hipthrust machine is far too tall and cannot be adjusted for women. In general, a super worn out gym and it doesn't help to paint the walls..."
Frano.0k,5,well equiped and very kind staff ☺️ always smiling
Anders Klüver,3,"Not as many good classes anymore. TRX and functional training classes are great for strength and cardio, but difficult to find a good class"
Emma H,5,"Great gym! So many good offers for memberships and lots of machines and equipment. The only negative thing I would say is that nobody is brining towels to have with them, which has usually been a requirement at gyms I go to. Therefore if people don't use the paper towels to clean you sometimes find a machine that is really sweaty and dirty and you have to clean it yourself! I think it would be nice if they changed that and asked people to bring towels for hygienic reasons. But otherwise I love the gym and would recommend! Really friendly staff too!"
Klaus Pedersen,5,"Great place to do your workout. New and always good maintained equipment, and their team activities are always with good instructors. Like most of the other Fitness World centers it's really good."
goran kozina,5,Very big space with lot of good machines in good state. Very friendly staff.
павук Бодя,1,"I think I am gonna quit that GYM, the same playlist for 5 months.....It's make me crazy. No way the reason of quitting will be music.... Please change it"
bendix holtgraefe,4,"Great fitness studio with nice and helpfull staff. The only drawback is the very unflexible membership system. I'm working abroad every other month and there is no suitable membership plan for a situation like this. I'm required to pay 100 DKK everytime I want to pause my membership when starting work, which isnt very nice."
Jakub Wieczorek,4,Clean but have some old equipment that could be replaced
Klaus Pedersen,5,Great fitness center with good classes. I've been very pleased with the friendliness and professionalism among their instructors and staff. It is a place you like to work out.
Myriam D,5,"Great place, nice separation of floors, clean."
Klaus Pedersen,5,"I like this center. Great location, great opening hours and a great size. It's not too big nor to small. I primarily attend the classes and find that they have great instructors. The locker rooms are nice and clean."
Lars Steenfeldt-Gjersøe,4,"Nice fitness center, they have a lot of squat racks, free weights and cardio machines. They do lack some of the traditional machines."
Rosendal,3,"It's fine for what it is, but half the lockers can't lock properly, and the machines are quite worn down."
Nikolaj Johannes Skole Jensen,4,"One of the better fitness centers, at least in the ""Fitness World"" line-up"
Dennis Au,2,Cluttered and strangely structured center. Disabled toilet and stretcher in the same room
Maria,2,"Bad vibes! Too many people, especially at this FW is starring at you if you actually do a good job and are serious about training. To fit in, you should stare at your phone and don’t pay attention to exercise at all.. 🫤 It’s a shame.. The culture makes me change to FitnessX !!"
Antonin Fronc,5,"Clean gym with everything I need for general bodybuilding purposes. Although some equipment is visibly worn out and the gym may be crowded at times, it's not a reason to complain given the price and 05:00-24:00 opening times."
Angel Del Fabbro,2,"Really Cheap fitness chain. Nothing luxury. Nothing to make the experience better. Dated cardio machines. Everything feel old. No improvements in 10 years in technology applied to training or experience. Quite dirty, low maintenance. Dirty change rooms, not even soap in showers. Weird people hanging out but not training. Unfortunately they are like a monopoly, not other options in the city. Danes have high income but the gyms are really lame and basic compared to other countries."
Ben Brownlee,4,"A good part of the Fitness World chain of gyms. Not their biggest gym in Aarhus, but it is spacious and well laid out. There are areas for cardio, machines, circuit training, free weights and a well-placed number of squat racks. Two large rooms are available for group classes.

The recent refurb has given a well deserved refresh to the place. Staff were very attentive when we were coming out of the covid restrictions. They seem to have fallen back into old patterns since. But are generally friendly and are there to help out.

My second favourite Fitness World in Aarhus."
Gabe Avenia,3,"Gym is decent, but there is no air-conditioning in the summer which makes it just unbearable. Also no WiFi and mediocre maintenance."
Jonx,5,Overall a great spacious gym with many facilities
Rekai Ewan Campbell,4,Great gym with a lot of the latest equipment. Can be a bit crowded at times but never to the point that you cant work around it. They offer tours of the place so ask for one and check the place out.
Daniel Carlsson,4,Really nice gym with a lot of equipment! They have everything you need for a good training session. There can be a lot of people around 16-18.
András Tóvölgyi,2,After the pandemic I was promised to get compensated by reduced fares. It never happened and it continued to charge me with 189kr.
H,5,"Great gym, best I've tried in Aarhus for the price.
Equipment is new, clean and much nicer to use than FW - locker room is a little small"
Bardia Varasteh,1,"The staffs are super nice that is why I give this star for them.
But sorry that I cannot add any more stars since the center is super crowded! No matter when you go! Early morning! Evening! Week days weekends.... I think they should introduce some rule and dont accept new members since the center is too small for the people wanna to do workout! The last two times I had to just leave since I could not find any free spot to do workout!"
Lucian Constantin,2,Pretty bad compared to the other places fitness world centers I've been to in Aarhus
Tom,4,"Nice staff, clean. But missing simple things like a holder for soap in the shower, more ""cleaning stations"""
Nikolay Yurukov,5,Nice gym
Thor,5,"Clean gym, friendly staff, Working Machines"
Denis Owczynski,1,"Worst customer service and this brand is only interested in your money, they will do everything to screw you over for the smallest amount of your money."
Poul Wrist,4,"Decently equipped gym. Good amount of free weights, machines and other features."
Andreea - Madalina Balas,4,The machines are new and the stuff is very friendly and ready to assist.
Las HS,4,Wish there were some kind of security
Davor Jovanov,5,Good place to relax and get fit
Ariana-Claudia Pop,5,"What I like to this gym is that the owner always buys something new ❤️ all members are polite, they don't stare, they don't yell or moan when they exercise and everything is clean. The culture of this place is different form any other brand gym in town, it is really friendly and you can exercise in peace. It is very well equipped, there is no exercise you can't do, and is not crowded. The price is under the market price! This gym should get more 5 stars reviews. I tried it for one month and then decided to become a regular 😊"
Marck Skov,1,"Be careful; it is impossible to cancel a subscription with Infitness. Half a year after cancellation, they still send bills, despite verbally confirming the cancellation of the subscription in person at the centre on Møllevangs Allé 142."
Theodora Irava,1,"Totally disappointed!
I chose this gym because it was the cheapest from the town. Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.
When I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership. The staff is hardly speaking English.
I strongly recommend to avoid this gym."
Derrick Derby,1,Registered just yesterday and they sending me a bill. Haven't received a card yet to train. Customer service is really not cool. Disappointed already
Rosa Horcajada Capdevila,1,"I don't recommend this gym if you are an international. No English. Also, I had a lot of trouble with the payments and also to unsubscribe."
Mohammed Al Ahmadi,2,Very small
Flex Trafik,3,"Nice place to move around a bit, unfortunately they don't have bathing facilities or treadmills 🥲"
MS B,1,"Please note that if a subscription is put on hold and later has to be terminated, you are forced to activate it and pay 1-2 months' subscription before it is terminated."
Orla Olsen,5,Good machines and great music. You really want to give it gas 😃
Martin Filtenborg,4,"No-nonsense fitness for people who don't mind all the posturing with 'the right clothes and the right drinking bottle', mirrors everywhere and whatnot."
Thai Hiep Bui,1,"Members do not clean after themselves, do not put the weight back
The gym is messy and dirty. The floor is nasty. The weights are everywhere but on the racks. The bottom floor that is in the cellar is humid as hell. Equipments are not maintained and a lot of them are broken or have flaws. The rubber bands that are available for use are so dirty and sticky. The only reason I keep the membership is because it is literally 2 minutes from where I live. Do not recommend to anyone, not worth the money."
Par Kla,2,"The equipment looks like all the broken leftovers from the other gyms. The usual guests have no manners. No one puts equipment back in their place, the gym always looks like a mess."
alex billesbølle,4,You can sweat here :-)
Peter Dam Mains,2,"Always messy, and the equipment/machines are cheap."
Marck Vilstrup,5,God service
Lenka Švidrnochová,5,"Amazing spacy gym with long opening hours, parking and modern machines."
Bącław xD,3,"Tge gym is fine, but people here do not put weigths on their place"
Aleksejs Krasovskis,1,Do not recommend if you don't want to be boiled. It's too hot inside and no proper ventilation.
Ben Brownlee,4,"A good-sized gym on several floors, with a large variety of free weights, machines and classes. Not the tidiest Fitness World you'll find; weight plates often strewn around the area rather than stacked on a weights tree."
Sreejit Dey,5,"The environment is nice to workout.
The equipments are in very good condition.
But only there is a bit more rush in the afternoon.."
Konrad Płecha,5,"Great place, a lot of machines and heavy lifting space, big fitness room suitable for stretching or warming up session."
Badrinath Veluri,1,"It is new facility and the equipment is worst. I have seen many not in working mode even after few days.

Treadmills are worse and not installed properly. They are very tiresome and I have said many times to the staff but no actions.

The staff is kind and good but no action towards the improvements we suggest."
Mike Kosiakov,5,"Good local fitness center. Rush hours from 17 to 19, better go after or before these hours. Please, add new music videos."
Ahmet E,5,Just love it
Jesper Søkbæk,3,"Not the biggest Fitness World, you can safely say, there aren't many parking spaces. So you have to stop at Bilka if you come in prime time, i.e. around 16 to 18:00.

The place is open until 00:00 on weekdays, so that everyone can get a workout in. There isn't bikefit and all that cycling like in the really big centres."
Martin Damgård Nielsen (Marhlder),2,"Great place for a casual workout. Not super clean and they are generally not very good at maintenance of their exercise machines, but most of their customers probably don't notice because they don't put on a lot of weight. I have been asking them multiple times to fix various things, but it seems everything that costs money comes at a slow place even though it seems they have plenty of customers.
Update: They think it's a good idea to turn off the lights and they no longer provide cloths for wiping the machines 👎
I think they have misunderstood the concept of inflation, raise the prices don't make the product worse..."
Magdaléna Ostárková,5,Great place for working out. Very clean
Nikolaj Johannes Skole Jensen,3,"Okay little fitness center, with a competent staff that knows what they are doing"
Panneerselvam Subramaniam,5,Wonderful GYM.
Jette Mikkelsen,5,"Nice place to train. Appreciate 2 floors.
Always friendly staff who guide in the best way"
Simon Winther Schor,5,"Well maintained.

Some private people added their kettle bells to the facility (locked in cables, naturally). Very nice."
ANDREA GARRETTA,5,Wonderful place to workout your body outdoor! The best are the kettlebells 🧨 Recommended
Nils,5,Actually nice place. I use my TRX here
Carmine Zonno,5,nice corner for stretching and training
Марк Буйкин,4,It's really good!! 😄
Julius Leon,4,"Good, large Calipark with a nice view, but some equipment doesn't function properly."
Rob Arias,2,"Ok, but it could be more thought out with, for example, a pull-up bar on which you can do muscle ups, as well as replace some of the immediate weird inclined bars with something that can be used. It's a shame that those who set up these workout stations do not start from practical exercises or set up suggestions for exercises."
Hjalte Møller,5,"I often use this outdoor gym and if you can find out how to use the different training stands, you can easily get a good workout with lots of sweat on your forehead 🙂

There are also some good running routes right out on Fælleden 👍🙂"
Elzbieta Jarzyna,5,"Great place, walking and relaxing"
Anker Stang,4,Exciting district.....
Anastasia Balova,3,It was great befor they changed it.
Vagn Mortensen,2,Cold and desolate
Ismail Aden,5,Good place to train
Vladyslav Zavalykhatko,5,
Vilma Errboe,5,
Pamela,4,Nice spot by the water but very noisy from the motorway
Rajesh Kumar,5,Nice place for walking around the water and also outside fitness park .
Ruwan Chaminda Sampath,5,Nice place. Very important for exercise people.
Henrik Rasmus Andersen,5,Good view. Nice shelter.
Jacob Johnsen,4,Great equipment and view
Henrik Rasmus Andersen,4,This exercise park is to my knowledge the only one in the area that has a Leg Press machine. It lacks a machine for stomach exercises.
Miguel Trabado,4,Sublime
Ioulia Per,4,
Hernan C,5,Great park to train un Copenhagen. Five stars
Daniel Jajetic,5,Great street workout park!
Silvia severino,5,
Casper Karlsmose Andersen,5,
Inna Yuryeva,5,"Nice Park!
There are a lot of activities: Aqua Park,skate place,open air gum,birds, children place, etc.
My kids was totally happy)))"
Yevheniia Кulish,5,I love the outdoor gym❤️ thank you Lund
Viktor Lindström,5,Nice
Hugo Hedin,5,"Great outdoor gym! There are pull-up bars, parallel bars, monkey bars, fixed barbells (10, 20, 30 kg ish) and some other equipment. There are also beach volleyball courts and a parkour section next door. The pull-up bar is somewhat rickety, but instead you can drive in the parkour part."
Oscar Gustavsson,5,Perfect for a little exercise after running. There is equipment so you can train all body parts and weights are available in different sizes.
Anders Emil,4,
Anton Nikolov,3,"Pretty much only the pull up bars are useful, the reset of the facilities are more for kids entertainment.  Still good area for doing exercises."
Preben Kjærsgaard,5,"Irmabyen, fantastic area"
Alejandro Barrios,5,"So far, the best equiped outdoor gym that I've been too. Pullup bars at different heights, walls, soft floor. Great for calisthenics. I would say it is my favorite"
mmarleenn,5,"Nice place to workout, it was fun even tho it was raining a bit"
Wahid Rezai,4,"Good equipments, nature atmosphere and fresh air!"
Claudio Forniti,5,"Pretty cool spot where you can train tons of body movements exercises. Pull-ups bar, dips, push-ups, abs and back extensions station too. Go there and smash your daily workout."
David O,5,"My favourite utegym in malmö: bars for pull-ups, dips, rubberized floor space and more."
Lennart Akesson,5,Perfect for me and old man 👴
marianne Hansen,5,"Live right next door ❤️ so polish your fingers away from the city of the ancients, you don't even live nearby."
moonvine,5,Really good training place
Nanna Vetterlain,5,Good training spot in quiet surroundings
Alexander Black,5,Thank you
Krister Flores,4,"Enough for some basic calisthenics, only cons are that muscleups are not possible on the pullupbar cause of its design and it is a bit inclined. But if it's the closest gym to you, then it will be more than enough for most workouts."
Luis Rubio,3,"A little outdoor gym with a focus on knowing the equipment, otherwise you get a little instruction in the form of a board on what you can do."
anna kruba,5,The park that I love 🍒🌺🥰
Jonas Bergkvist,3,
Gordana Lloshi,4,
Titus Yabira NDAHI,5,Beautiful place for exercise
--,1,Badly! bad quality. People who do these outdoor gyms know nothing about calisthenics. Look at outdoor gyms in the USA and Russia and you will understand everything.
Andy Truong,4,
Anna Winstedt,5,
Abhiram Diyyala,3,
teresa hon,5,"Great fitness experience here at Strandparken Gym Copenhagen Tower! Camila the personal trainer I met today was very professional. Highly recommend! She taught me a lot about fitness and nutrition, from the big-picture frameworks to the specific muscles each exercise was building. Her demos were clear and she was attentive to my form/technique. She gave personalised feedback on how to incorporate healthier choices in my daily routines too! Overall this gym is truly high quality well run brand new gym!"
Stephan “Stephan”,5,"Highly recommend gym. Very supportive and nice staff. All equipment feels brand new and everything is super clean.

They also have a big reck for cross fit and calisthenics. If you want a very good equipped and beautiful gym, this is your place."
Cristian Letai,5,"Great place to work out! It’s clean and quite stylish! There’s a good selection of machines and cross-fit training options and they offer classes as well.

The gym also has an app where together with the trainers you build a program to follow. The app has videos on how to properly do each exercise plus the trainers are always there to check on you and give advice.

I highly recommend it!"
Jesper Løvendahl,5,"Great place! High-end equipment and facilities, plus excellent service."
Andreas M Hansen,1,"Was really happy with the center. But the way of handling the closure is quite strange. With a few days' notice, the center will be closed and the subscription will be paused. I just paid 599 for a month's subscription a few days before the closure was announced, giving me the offer to train at the other end of town is not doing me any good. I have tried to write several emails about getting one's money back instead, but have not received any reply.."
Drew,5,Absolutely love this place everything is fun to play on I feel like a big kid and my friend from Australia 🇦🇺 loved it to every time we come to visit Copenhagen I have fun here great out side gym free to enter and stay as long as you like such a great place
ANDREA GARRETTA,5,"Suuuper ! You can workout to the best, done right!"
Azn Bruh,4,Good place to do calisthenics exercises with a great waterfront view.
Anton Bachinski,5,Best outdoor gym in town!
Hristo Topov,5,Very good place for calisthenics. Pleasure to be there.
Stephane Coué,4,
Azn Bruh,3,"Nice and quiet place to do some outdoor workout. You can do a few calisthenics exercises at this place. If you want to do more advanced calisthenics exercises, you can head over to the playground nearby (approximaly 100 meters). At the playground you will find bars to do pull ups or muscle ups."
Albin Klang,5,
Hila Rious,5,such a perfect place to work out. It's even possible to follow your protocol in the darkness here as there is light.
Jan Friberg,4,

Andrew Jorgensen,5,"In Copenhagen for 6 nights and my hotel had a terrible gym, so I searched for a nearby gym and found SATS. I found this gym to be great! It has just enough equipment to get in a good workout. I never had to wait for anything. The team was also super helpful with getting me day passes."
Joshua Formentera,4,"Newly nice renovated gym. Classy and has a nice view to the street. All the equipments, cardio machines and lockers in the room are brand new and nice. The men's shower room has only five compartment room compared to the old ones which have around eight. There is a sauna too. The voice echo from the women's bathroom loud as it gets and everyone from the men's room can hear everything. Not sure if the management have notice it. In comparison from other SATS gym this place relatively small.  Great location fitness center and accessible to public transport few minutes walking distance to the central station and Tivoli gardens."
C L,5,5-star rating for the second floor lounge. I was running around the park 630am and needed a bathroom and a coffee. SATS is perfect for just that. I didn’t try the gym. Neither do I see the point of paying for cardio machine when you are so close to a beautiful park in summertime.
Guido Nap,3,"The gym is ok, although with rising prices I guess it became a bit expensive for what it offers. It is a bit small but very modern and fairly clean. At least more than other gyms I have seen in Copenhagen. It is often packed when it comes to using the barbell stations but definitely, I have seen it worse.

The staff is usually nice, although when you have a question (e.g. about billing etc.) it is all managed in a very confusing way. I do not think is their fault, but rather something related to their internal procedures and IT systems.

The classes are in Danish, but you can also find classes in English. Besides the language barriers, I find the classes useful and entertaining. Usually, the instructors are of a good level and there is quite a good variety.

The app is a welcome help for booking classes and other functions, although sometimes the user experience could be improved (and the same with the website).

I am still a client and I think the gym has the potential though to become even better. It depends on what the management will make out of it."
Eric H,4,"Small, but well equipped fitness center.

SATS have a bunch of different spots in Copenhagen and if you don't like the size, there are always others.

Personally, I feel like this is one of the better, if you just want to get in and do a workout and get out. You'll rarely wait for a spot anywhere.

They have everything you need including 6 squat racks / power cages and a bunch of free weight stuff, cardio machines. The only thing lacking is team workout.

The changing rooms are good and spacious.

It does get extremely hot in the summer here, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
Kasper Sørensen,5,"THE place for squatting, benching, and deadlifting in northern Copenhagen.
KSK-styrke.dk to get in contact. Usual opening hours are 14-19 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
Jesper Rune Madsen,5,Super fantastic club. Lovely people of all ages. Lots of rallies. And a really good atmosphere.
Khalid Sapneh,1,"I tried to contact the club to sign up, but I was told by Anders that there is a waiting list and I have to contact a Per on a phone number as a man who never answers his phone.

It takes a long time for the ruling and the bad to respond.

For me that is a bad experience and I do not recommend the club due to bad behaviour."
Cindy P.,5,Good experience and you feel welcome already from day 1.
Amalie Larsson,5,A club where there is room for everyone and good technical sparring. The mood is high and so is the level.
Dan Eisenberg,5,"Really Nice crossfit center, very high equipment standard and nice People"
Mikio Karmann,5,Love this box and the members. You quickly feel welcome and the training is good.
rasmus windfeld-hansen,5,"Fantastic community, good trainers and great equipment."
Susanne Visholm,5,"Cool facilities, welcoming staff."
Henrik Woodgates,5,"Training where everyone can participate and be challenged at their own level. The team behind the box is very passionate, the emphasis is on community and training of the highest quality."
Mikkel,1,
Dóra Lakatos,5,
Sazzad Ahmed,5,Nice and good stuffs.
Rikke Klarskov,5,It is a pure pleasure to come to Physio Danmark. They are all welcoming and helpful. Sofie is one of the best physiotherapists I have met. She thoroughly familiarizes herself with your movement patterns and biases before a program is organised. It has really created great positive changes for an office body
Mark Petersen,4,"A really good place if you have sore joints or muscles.
The staff are nice and welcoming and they also have equipment for rehabilitation if you need it.
The prices are okay, but it would be best if you get a referral from your doctor, as is the case with such places."
Tove Krøyer Sørensen,5,Good service and treatment
Thomas Theede Lauridsen,5,"Go to Nicklas for problems with my neck, it's always a great pleasure to see him. The humor is world class, and the treatment is serious and efficient on a different level."
Yihong Lan,1,"I had the misfortune of being a member of this CrossFit gym and I must say, it has been nothing but a complete disaster. Despite leaving the country and clearly cancelling my membership, this gym continued to charge me a recurring fee, month after month. I was shocked and frustrated to see this charge appearing on my credit card statement, especially as I was no longer in the country and had no access to their facilities.

The customer service provided by this gym was equally disappointing. I tried reaching out to them multiple times, via email, to rectify this issue but my requests were ignored or brushed off. It took a significant amount of time and effort on my part but they had no interest in resolving the issue.

In my opinion, this gym is clearly more concerned about lining their pockets rather than providing a quality service to their customers. Their lack of attention to customer service and unethical billing practices is unacceptable and I would not recommend this gym to anyone. Stay far away from this gym if you value your money and time."
Louise Nielsen,3,"Let's get down to business, to defeat the weights.
Did they send me fatties, when I asked for strongs?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Crosser, I'll make a hunk out of you

Sweaty as a river but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win (the Hungarian handstand)
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue (about how awesome crossfit is)
Somehow I'll make a hunk out of you

(the users say:)
""I'm never gonna catch my breath""

- ""Say goodbye to those who knew me""
('cause all my friends are crossfitters now)

- ""Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym"" (weren't we all?)

- ""This guy's got 'em scared to death"" (with his abs)

- ""Hope he doesn't see right through me"" (just keep your shirt on, no-one wants to see your sixpack Brad).

-""Now I really wish that I knew how to swim"" (a shower will do).

Be a hunk
We must be swift as the swinging dumbbell
Be a hunk
With all the force of a great weight disc
Be a hunk
With all the strength of a heavy lever
SoMe-showing as the light side of the moooooooooon!"
Lucas Barro,5,Love to train in this box
Bergur Johannesen,4,I've attended around 300 classes here and absolutely love it. But be aware of the fact that it requires a membership and is very expensive.
Christian Palm,5,"Great place to workout, small open gym but great classes"
Gianluca Gulino,4,"Very nice gym. Daily fee around 10 euro.
Good quality machines. Only problem there's not always someone in the reception."
Hendrik H,1,Couldn’t workout because staff at the reception was missing.
Robbie Dyer,4,"Good gym with plenty of new equipment, and it's always kept very clean."
Nilus24 Fußball,4,"super nice trainings place, but in the first floor, you can sometimes smell the restroom. I would suggest a strong ventilation system"
Eric Langenberg,5,"Spacious, light, clean, great equipment, not crowded. Everything seems new, worked well, and is in great shape. Perfect gym. First time is free."
Mandy Marquardt,5,"I was in town for vacation and wanted to continue my training — what a gem of a facility! They have plenty of squats racks and platforms. It’s a well-organized, friendly and clean space. I NEVER felt uncomfortable or unwelcomed. I took two CrossFit classes while in town with Ezequiel and I loved his energy. I had to modify a couple exercises and he was very flexible and encouraging. When I am in Copenhagen again, I’ll for sure be back!"
Pearlyn Toh,1,"Quality of (some) coaches are great, but others couldn’t care less during class — mostly on the phone or chatting with others instead of watching the class.

Cancellation fees imposed on members for late cancellation, but they can cancel class last minute on their side without explanation.

Multiple instances during class at 6am in the morning that the coach did not show up at all, without explanation or apology either. so we had to conduct the class on our own and still pay for membership.

I’m sure there are other boxes that are more worthy of your time and money."
jakob meurs,2,"The gym's equipment quality is far below what ordinary fitness centers have to offer, and it is usually not super clean. The space isn't really big enough for the number of members which results it you having to wait in line for most of the equipment, especially if you wan't to train outside of a 9-17 works hours. Most of the team workout trainers are however really great and involved in the workouts which is really awesome. The ""administrative staff are however not ""great"", I both had troubles with my payment when i joined butchers, which was really annoying and also when I wanted to quit. To be honest they and the center were a big disappointment for me personally."
JP Ngindu,5,"A couple of Open Gym drop-ins while I stayed there and I can’t recommend it enough. The place is great, kept airy and fresh by hot weather and the staff and members super friendly. I’d fogotten my rope and asked if they had any spare and although they did not, one coach actually lent me hers!! Thanks Isabel!"
Everton Spader,5,Love the box! All coaches are super friendly and in my experience they don’t mind speaking English even if there’s only one English speaker in the room. The facilities here are great. Weightlifting area with top quality weights and barbells. Open gym is also very spacious with high quality equipments.
Lasse Buhl,3,"It's fine, it's got the equipment you need, and in expected condition, the staff was present and helpful, it's just a bit too expensive. The vibe to me was very club'ish, dim lighting with a few strong spotlights (got me blinded doing exercises on the floor), and heavy beating music, which is awesome if you're into that. The changing room felt kinda weird, the benches were grated, which made them uncomfortable to sit on. All in all, it was fine, but it just felt like any other gym, but with a monthly fee of 350+ dkk, it doesn't seem all that worth to me:/"
Michelle Dulce,1,"Can’t call their location in Østbanegade. Plus, they are super slow at responding on Instagram. They are very curt and not informative at all.

To Repeat, If you want to keep your customers, please be responsive, helpful and informative. Poor communication really discourage me as a member at your fitness center."
Edson Bittencourt Imperico,5,"Excellent gym with good music and atmosphere to work out, and cheaper rates per month than other gyms in town. Open until midnight."
Ferdinand Laird,5,Fitness with character
Abdulrahman,5,Very nice experience 👌
Mate Kelava,5,"This PureGym is a great gym, spacious and clean. Has everything you need for a good workout. I got a week pass as a tourist for 109dkk. The girl at the reception was super friendly and helpful! I definitely recommend"
Jo J,5,"One of the best Fitnessworlds in Copenhagen.
Airy, spacious with 4 floors, nice staff and gym is well equipped.
Warmly recommend the all-in offer they have where you can take one item like protein shakes, water, protein bars or caffeinated drinks from their member fridge everyday for 119:-/month"
Jeffrey Taveras,5,"Wonderful training facility with all the necessary basics. I'm from the states and was worried I wouldn't find a place to train but Fitness world fulfilled my needs. As a powerlifter, I solely needed a decent barbell and squat rack. They have 4! Guest passes at the time cost 99kr for a week!"
Nicolai Zoffmann,5,"Great place where the stairmasters are replaced with many real stairs to escalate the many floors. The layout is easy to understand. Change rooms are on the bottom floor and then each floor specialises in different types of workouts. Be aware that if you use the stairs to exercise, the top floors are mainly for team exercises and can be clogged from time to time.

Try to avoid peak periods between 07-10 and 16-19 if you wish to you specific tools, machines or spots."
Krisztian Gyepes,4,"Spacious gym with great equipment however, it gets crowded in the afternoon/ early evening. Membership costs around 250 dkk per month and I think it is definitely worth the money!"
Claus Moeller,4,If you get there when it's not busy.  Generally too much noise because doors are not closed and people don't always use headphones
Kim Døfler,5,Great classes and nice new equipment 👌
Jan Ankerstjerne,5,Fitness X is a great place where there is new machines and lots of classes. The price is awesome
Armand Cee,5,"Hi, i want ask is it possible to mount a boxing bag on the gym?"
Atif Haroon,5,The best offers of the town.
PsychoGG,5,"This has become  my second home, always  awesome  people  willing to help    never had a problem  being judge  or something  the gym works and has everything that you need ( i would love to see a traps machine, but that is just a personal preference😁)  Thank you FitnesX for helping me change my life"
Tanya Pavlenko,5,"Signed up about a month ago, good variety of classes at convenient times for those who work as well (morning and evening), plenty of space in classes so rarely see something waitlisted. My Danish is very basic, but instructors are accommodating and I never feel discriminated against. Wish some classes were available at 7 or 8 am instead of 6, but that's a personal preference. Keep up the good work!"
Mateos Lazari,5,"Really cool place with great machines and all kind of weights, the only bad thing about it is many peoples don’t respect the place with leaving tons weights at the machines when they are done of the exercises, many peoples come and stuck on the phone using space for nothing and last and at least people dont respect the hygiene so when you have to go to locker room it smells really bad and toilets/showers are really dirty and sticky, hopefully they are going to make it better in the future."
J,1,"It's unfortunate one cannot give 0 starts to this company, which does not fall short of a scam. The terms and conditions for payment are obscure to say the least, and they have now decided to allow payments only via MobilePay, which clearly shows their reluctancy to admit international clients or even any clients not familiar with app payments. To be avoided by all means."
Emre Duymaz,5,Pretty huge and brand new Gym. So much space for everything you need. It's a great gym for those who want to do more CrossFit style workouts but not pay the high CrossFit fees. The locker rooms are great too. Something that you don't see often. Feels more like a members only Gym
Lewis Atkins,2,"Just a very bad gym. Staff don’t really care, don’t blame them tbh it’s miserable in here. All-in deal is bad value. Lots of equipment but the space is pretty sad and windowless"
Rune Perstrup,1,"An Unhygienic Coronavirus Petri Dish.

I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously."
Mario Piazza,1,"In a huge gym there is only one hair dryer and it’s not working. I asked the staff to fix it one week ago and they told me they will replace it immediately. Today still the same problem and it’s even dangerous as the wire is open. I told the staff guy that I suffered from sinusitis and have to blow my long hair. I even asked him to give me the one in the women’s changing room for few minutes. He said the hair dryer is fixed. When I asked him how is it possible that in such a huge gym there is no other hair dryer, he told me that they didn’t bring the new hair dryer yet and there is no other one. Unacceptable."
Emil Lassen,5,"It's a great gym with basically everything you could want or need, there is access to lockers both in the dressing rooms and when you enter the center. You enter using a card or bracelet, which is great since it's open 24/7. The only bad thing is that some of the members, don't put their plates and dumbbells back where they belong."
Frank Ejby Poulsen,3,"The gym is great, spacious and has everything, and the personel is friendly and helpful.

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded."
Amit K Mishra,5,All modern equipment are available at a reasonable subscription rate. Definitely I will join soon.
Mikkel Thygesen,3,"Good facilities, but it is in dire need of better climate control. It's only about 19c outside now but the inside the gym is burning (when doing workouts obviously). The group hall is even worse because they're not allowed to open the windows."
Christian Haugbølle,1,"Signed up and regretted my subscription within the 14 days cancellation period. I had a very, very hard time getting them to understand that I should not pay for the rest of the month + 1 month if I cancelled within 14 days (they even asked if I had actually READ their terms, which I had ... and turned out their center-leader had not, which was very awkward for her). I can't recommend Fitness World."
D Kar,5,"Huge training space. Good quality classes. Would be great for me if instructor use a little bit of English too for the people who don't speak danish.
I like fitness world."
Ivan Vlasov,1,"I checked on their website that they are open and offer one-time visit. I came, waited for 10 minutes - no administrator appeared (the client/members were there), and then I left this place."
Bartosz Gałecki,3,"Air conditioning is not turned on. Instead they put a couple of fans around the gym, which just move hot air around. Not super clean but I've been to worse places. Some machines are broken for weeks without maintenance.

Good thing is that people put the weights back"
wandyr hagge,4,"Nice place for a work out. Clean. Fairly good equipments. Within the price range of other facilities. A bit under-staffed, in my opinion. Difficult to find someone to ask a question. And even If you find someone, It is not sure you will get an answer..."
Thomas Kägi,4,Visited this gym during my vacation. It has Seen better times but Its still good to get some gains:-)
Joar Torbiörnsson,1,Had my membership cancelled in the counter in proper time but still had to pay additional month.
Mikhail Nikitin,1,"One can talk about broken machines or dirt in the changing rooms, but I realize that things can't be ideal all the time. So I'd say it all goes relatively well until one needs to talk to someone beyond the helping guys in the centre. The company doesn't have a phone number to call. They have a chat, which main purpose seems to relay a message ""Fill in the online contact form"". When you do, there is a waiting time from hours to days. And if you get an answer, it never changes regardless whether you can prove them wrong or lying. They merely stop responding. And there's nothing you can say to someone who is not willing to listen."
Mark Saraira,1,"If it possible to give 0 star a will, i cancel my membership and tell the staff in the gym that i gonna move to another city, the say ok but the money for February we cannot give it to you back(i train 1 time in February), i say ok just cancel me member the say ok, now 01.03.2023 the received from my card again 239 for nothing!!, i’am in another city i cant go to the gym and they still received from my card money, stupid rules and the manager who say to me in February you will not pay anymore is lier. I will never ever update my membership again in your gym, (take my money for nothing)."
Angi Las,1,"The Studio is not in best Shape. As Many before me wrote: it’s very small, the devices are packed!! Could be a lot cleaner - especially the toilets.
But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.
Will go to another fitness world studio in the future and hope that the next one will be more modern and clean und the staff maybe a little more educated."
Daniel Storm,2,"Watch out! In the mens changing rooms there are someone unscrewing the locks so they can open the lockers even if you have your own lock on.

This has been a big problem over the last year. And Fitness World do not inform you about this!!!!"
Eduardo Simões,1,"Attention! I have noticed some screws missing in the locks of the locker room (males). This allows the door to be opened even with a lock. Always choose a locker with screws as the screws cannot be removed with a lock on. Also, booking system is problematic."
Navid Mosadeghi,5,It’s clean and well equipped.
Aleksandar Maricak,3,Relative okay gym. Matrix machines are not the best and the Nautilus were better before renovation. Dumbbells are not put in the correct location and it is always overcrowded. Not enough machines compared to the demand.
Type One Fitness,1,They changed the cost of a guest fee from 50kr to 69kr and the new Matrix equipment is so so so uncomfortable. Since PureGym took over this place it is easily the worst gym in Østerbro!
Ẹniọlá,4,"Go-to location.
Very spacious and always clean.
Staff are nice and helpful.
And overall atmosphere is very easy going yet focused and motivating :)

Check it out yourself though"
KlippeG,2,"Nice location, but very small center compared to how many people train there. You have to be lucky sometimes to get a treadmill. It has been a chronic problem since I started there last summer that many treadmills do not work, and unfortunately it is only getting worse. Has a good area in the basement for stretching"
Arthur Golshani,5,"Top gym ! Top équipement, ideal for foreigners as it is possible to get daily / weekly pass."
Thomas Jakins,4,"Never really too busy but it is quite small. Like alot of fitness worlds it could update the machines.
Generally its very clean, its one of the better fitness worlds."
Carlos Olivo,5,Very nice gym. I got a week pass for 110 dkk or something like that wich is really surprisingly cheap for this quality gym. You can also do daily passes. The only thing to bear in mind that after 6pm and on the weekends there is no one to check you in so come before if you want to singup and then you can use the gym using a card until midnight.
Heninho,1,Gym has only very limited service times. Impossible to workout after this time if you only want to workout for a day.
Sharad Govil,5,Great Gym- I was a bit nervous as this is my first time to a gym in Denmark but the front staff was very friendly and helpful. For 99DKK I could get a pass for a week. It opens from 5:30 AM to 10:00 PM. The timing showed in google is when front staff is available. You need an access card to enter so if you are first times from overseas go after 8:00 AM so staff can open the door for you.
Andres Arevalo,5,Nice place with daily and weekly passes. Make sure you get there in the hours that the receptionist is working otherwise you cannot buy the passes.
Tyler C,1,"They always play games with pricing. Claim it's 134,50/month, then want to charge 143,18 with no explanation of the extra fee. It's clear you simply can't trust Fitness World."
Nicolas Wirth,3,"Medium cleanliness, too few barbell racks compared to the total area this gym covers. Could be better, could be worse. It has never been too crowded and the clientele is nice."
Lassana Sanogo,5,"This gym is very clean, not overcrowded and reasonably priced. Give it a try."
subnet001,3,"If you wish to pick up heavy things and put them down again in the ugliest building in town you've come to the right place. This place has it all! It's got infinite running things, stay-still-pedallers, heavy handles, pull ropes, hard-to-pick-up-if-you're-weak balls, make-your-life-difficult machines and hulahoops. All are kept well maintained and on a leash if necessary. According to rumors, there are also classes for different things but I don't know anything about that. Get the app,  it helps with stuff I've never used and looks nice.

*EDIT* I'm revoking a star for no longer being open 24 hours! I wanna lift at night! Otherwise, no change."
Bill C,5,"399 kroner for 1 month or 75 kroner for 1 day.  No commitment or long-term contract.  The gym has everything you could want, everything is new and very nice.  Staff is also very good.  Highly recommend."
popov dimitar,1,"Is the busiest fitness world what i ever seen before . It’s absolutely desastre. I cannot workout normally… today i make for 1h - just 3 exercises. I recommend to nobody subscribe there . They don’t care about the occupancy… (may be we need new covid pandemy) sale and sale new memberships. Also they grow up with the price ? For what? Unfortunately I’m looking for other place with a months; just here is noone option. I hope other companies make good the marketing. Repeat: not subscribe in this gym you will sorry a lot 😪 doesn’t matter the day; weekends ; evenings or mornings all the time is full full full , no one place free to work ! You pay your money for nothing!"
Sebastian,1,"Unfortunately this gym has been severely worsened by the “upgrade” in connection with the change to PureGym.
The machines (Matrix) are really bad and it seems that there’s less equipment too.
Will not be coming back."
Wouter Roosen,4,"Really like this gym,  I just think it gets a bit dirty. They vacuum every day but that seems to be it.  A lot of equipment and different types: machines,  free weights, kettle bells, balls etc... and great space too"
Lucas C,2,"They should put more space to park the bikes, it is very busy in the afternoon and I didn't like that they made me take off my shoes when that rule is not written anywhere"
Fab Indi,5,"Very nice gym with brand new machines. Very clean, paint is all new and staff is super nice.

Price is also great."
J Masnec,3,"Ok gym for a chain. Slection of machines is good, slection of classes not so good. Not crowded. Highlight is the two squash terrains. Downside - you cant reserve them online if you're not a squash member. Fitness membership doesnt help, you have to have a seperate squash membership."
Isabel Monteiro,1,"Jesus Christ..
this place needs a deep cleaning !!!!  The shower is full of spiderwebs, the mats were all very wet of sweat..

Be careful at the room were they do boxing the wood floor is very slippery

Not enough  hygge but:

Friendly employees !
Cool time at the boxing class!"
Ewa Palenta-Rusin,2,"I give 1 star more than #fitnessworld actually deserves for the great ""hold"" instructors. Otherwise it is a poor service fitness center that want to rip you off at every turn. I got a special offer when I signed up because it was FW birthday - ""All-in"" free for one month. It was the end of month and I did not get to use it at all. But to my big astonishment, it was an opt-in subscription service, so I was actually billed for the next month without even being notified beforehand! I cancelled it right away but I had to pay for that month anyway. So I used it a few times. And here comes the next surprise - again I was billed for the product I ""bought"" on top of my monthly fee.
I am asking, is that what a reputable fitness chain do? I doubt.."
William Maddocks,4,"One of the better fitness worlds, nice and open, high ceilings, nice facilities.

Only thing that stopped it being 5 stars is the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom/shower areas sometimes"
Kirsten Evans,3,"Great place to work out, the Dance Fit class was really good.  But as with all FW centers a good cleaning, would be great!"
TheFelza,1,"I was told one thing in English, then made sign something else in Danish, so they could charge me for time I wasn't even in Denmark"
Theis Egeberg,5,"Pretty much every type of training equipment you find yourself needing. It is open 24/7 and has a nice system for entering and exiting. The place is clean and neat, and the atmoshpere is relaxed. A special plus about this center is the high ceilings making the air circulation very nice. Staff is always smiling and friendly, never felt that it was overcrowded with visitors, even at peak hours."
Roy Moukarzel,5,"One of the best places to train in Denmark. Many locations specially in Copenhagen, with good equipment."
Sqweebo1,5,"These 5 stars are for the hardworking staff who make this gym shine. If by some chance they have been laid off or furloughed due to the pandemic, please hire them all again."
Andre Harris,5,This place is really nice... has tons of machines to use and is open 24hr. Perfect if your trying to avoid the crowds.
Mathias Moslund,5,Good gym!
Huttan T. L,1,"As someone who have been in all FW's in Copenhagen, this place is by far the most horrid. Rude staff who seems like they hate their life. They lack a total grasp on how to give service (Talking ESPECIALLY the female ones). There is also ZERO atmosphere and place is very dirty and STINKS  utterly on each of its three (Small) floors . Just find another place than this, because this place is so outrageously bad it drains you from all motivation. Not exaggerating."
Lisa Apers,3,"Okay, it would however be really nice to have an indicator somewhere of how crowded it is. Also sometimes they play the music really loud (so loud that with headphones with noise cancelling even at the highest volume I can still hear it). Not even mentioning the music taste 😶."
Krzysztof Turczyn,4,"This place is great!
They have all you need and they're open 24 hours, if it was even a bit dirty it's because lazy members do not know how to behave! People working there are trainers and office staff they are not your slave and they are not there to clean you mess! But there is one thing that drives me crazy and I was trying to ignore it but it is a bit hard now... the music when the staff leaves. If any staff employee of FW is reading it, can you PLEASE contact the staff in this gym and asked them to when they leave at 8 PM maybe set some radio or some motivational music? There was this one day that the song got stuck it was play allllllllllll night long, the same one song, and it was not even a good one, and literally after 40 mins I left coz not even my headphones helped. And yesterday there was some country music. In general after 8 there is always ""not the best music"" and I think if it's like this I'd prefer to work out in silence.
But otherwise as I mentioned great place."
Anton Nikolov,4,"The fitness center has been improved in the last months. Still no classes though. Otherwise, it has all the needed facilities for full body training. Third floor is the best one! Free weights! :)"
Geraint Nott,2,"A lot of young people go to this gym, and don't appreciate or follow gym etiquette. Often leaving weights where they use them, don't clean the machines after use and often sit for a long time looking at their phones. The gym is not staffed all the time and so no one tells these children to clean up after themselves.

Otherwise the gym is fine with modern and working machines. It can be a little cramped in some areas where the free weights are used, but this wouldn't be a problem if people were not so entitled and treated it like their personal gym."
Mike Martins,1,"The average age of the members in this gym must be somewhere around 17/18 at the most. Its pretty close to a folkeskole, hence you'll find alot of kids and teenagers in this gym.They come in large groups and take all the space (in an already very small gym) by basically playing around, acting like they're at a playground.

Other than that, the gym is very dirty and messy (This is also due to most of these teenagers neither sanitizing/cleaning up after themselves) and the music is too loud as well as being very poorly choiced songs."
Stephen Kaplan,5,"Not large, but never really crowded. The most spotless fitness club I've been to.... They are constantly cleaning and members take care of the equipment also."
N H,4,"Good place, fun courses. However, some of the info is hard to access, as most of it is in Danish only. Sometimes courses get cancelled, and I do not receive a message about it, although I have signed up."
Stefan Müller,5,"Good fitness center with weekly memberships, perfect as a tourist. Many Courses and access to every center they have (and they have many in Copenhagen)."
Ahmad Kasem Haidar,3,"Englandsvej, It's good and I enjoy training there with different machines BUT I didn't give 5 stars because we have to refill our water bottles from the toilet sink!
Hope they will make a separate place for water."
Sebastian,1,"Yet another Fitness World center, which have been worsened by the PureGym-makeover.
Strenght training has been compressed into too little space and instead they added a lot of useless cardio equipment for amateurs. It’s becoming more and more clear that the latter is the clientele which PureGyms wants to cater to - not us, who consistently go to the gym +5 times a week.
It’s such a pity with this systematic destruction of the relatively few good gyms we have."
horia cunea,5,"Great place and great staff, also Victor was very helpful ans answered all my questions very nice"
Mikhail Nikitin,4,"After renovation they made an ""open office"" environment in the changing room. Bizarre. And still no soap or shampoo in the shower."
Jennifer C,5,"Excellent gym. Many locations, good value for money, friendly staff, well equiped and huge variety of classes."
Gregor Haeusler,2,"One star just for the nice location. The service ended his shift 10mins early and completely ignored me and another costumer waiting on the counter. The machines are mostly so old, they must be from the 90s. Not recommendable."
RUECKENWIND,1,"I'm shocked after reading reviews that are just 3 years old (urban gym) compared to today. Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

The only good thing are the other people, most of them are friendly. The gym itself is just disgusting and not worth the money. That's just the review for that certain location."
Tomas Sharky,5,"I think it's a great gym in regards to value price. Unfortunately there is no many branches. The gym is quite well equipped even with small basketball court, punch bag and paper towels. The whole gym has the urban vibe. I think it's good alternative to the well known ones in Denmark. The air ventilation does not seem to work properly, though."
Diego Alonso,3,Quite small. The free workout area is quite large
Andrei Grigorian,4,"Great gym for the price and accessibility. Very well cleaned and maintained with all the equipment you would ever need. Large free training area, kettlebells, plenty of barbells and plates."
TheFelza,1,"I was told one thing in English, then made sign something else in Danish, so they could charge me for time I wasn't even in Denmark"
Noah P,5,Great gym. 7 day free pass was available for traveling
Ricardo López,1,"Terrible.

They changes my membership 2 times without me telling to do so.
First time i has to pay a supplement of 100 dkk because a mistake of one of the brilliant guys working there.

Second time they set my main gym elsewhere, so today i had to pay 30dkk extra to go to the gym i usually go.

On top of that, the first mess they did was not fixed. It is impressive how Fitness World hire the brightest minds in Denmark."
Meritxell Fernández,5,Best FW center I have been too. Really clean and functional. The equipment is new and everything is in one floor. The only cons are the lack of hold classes.
Aditya Sachdev,4,Great place quiet a lot of space and all equipments are present.
Jakub Hupka,2,Please fix the gymnastic rings 🙏🙏 Otherwise decent gym.
Juan De Marzi,1,Weeks like this.
P-A M.,3,"I've worked out in three different gyms in Copenhagen and this one was clearly the worst. There aren't enough showers in the men's locker rooms and they are incredibly wastefull in water. Another low point is the door system letting you in the gym, which keeps denying you the entrance if you're not perfectly positioned inside the cabin - too much fuss for nothing. Also, there are many annoying teenagers that aren't there for serious training, they're loud and using the equipment for fun while other people want to go on with their workout.

Otherwise the amenities for the workout per se are good and various."
Jonas Vilkevicius,1,"Service has improved for the last 6 months, better management. However the audience that comes there is poor,  people are aggressive, taken several machines at once,  or sitting on one machine for ages prohibiting others from training, noisy, have no respect to others, often screaming . Needs some education on general public as many have no intelligence how to behave"
David Berger,4,"I’ve been a member for 3 months, and I’ve got to say the new management is doing a great job. Clean, open and welcoming. Not too many machines, but plenty of room for circuit training.

CrossFit, cardio, stretching, body weight, running, free weights, and machines."
Diala Géo,4,"Fitness world interesting sports club  there is a variety of sports equipment, the staff are nice, you have to avoid peak hours because there is a queue for training, the problem that I found  there aren't all the information about roles of subscription, for example when you want to take a vacation you can freeze the month, or also if you want to unsubscribe this month you have to pay another month and it was the surprise for my case and all this information is not clear at the beginning. in my opinion it better that they give notes about all the ruls and the options with 2 languages Danish and English for be Easy for all people or put it on the wall in the reception"
Rastislav Pitek,1,"I cannot comprehend how anyone could open a gym of this size without thinking about any ventilation or air conditioning whatsoever. Its humid, smelly, unpleasantly hot and always crowded… Not to mention that the distribution and number of equipment is terrible… Say good bye to bench press - you wont be able to find empty bench for you.
(But the staff is nice and kind)"
A. Sam,1,"Terrible customer service! I once been there as a guest to a class under a friend’s membership (+1 guest). I have never had a membership there and has never signed up for one, yet I have been receiving emails to pay 4 months with interest for late payment?! - and then they started sending me new emails on my e-Boks. Since when I have given you a consent to do so?? Every time I stop by the gym to raise this, there’s no one to ask. and there is no number associated with the gym to call!"
Patrik Belanyi,3,"3,5*
Good location, close to metro station.
Employees are nice and helpful.
Gym is usually clean but very small and you spend some time just waiting for machines.
Recommend to check favourite times so you can avoid busy hours.

Ventilation is probably not existing and there are so many people who don’t follow gym’s rules.
The price (319dkk) is not matching to what you get."
Max Christensen,1,"STAY AWAY!!!
They got ALL my contact informations wrong. So I had no real way of paying my monthly subscription, be course I could not log in. HAhaha. Then they went all RKI on me. Agressive bunch.
I ended up just quitting, paying the bill and moving to a better gym that's more organized."
Yousef Elnono,1,Some of their machines are old and in need of maintenance. Their treadmills are in really bad state but as you can see on the picture a technician is on the way. Months and months has passed and no sign of this technician. If you tell the staff in the center or contact then on email they will say that the they have escalated this issue but the fact is the management don’t care. It will soon be a year with no repairs being made…
Stefano Rosciano,1,"I'm foreigner and what I perceived from this gym it was:

Some of the staffs are incredible unprofessional.

Employees must be trained on which are the rules and procedures.

P.s. a bit of politeness would be appreciated

Thank you,

Steve"
Anthon Anthoniussen,2,Not the best I have been at but need some more times at the Gym before evaluating
Muhammad Naveed Anjum,4,Good
Zilong Liu,5,Few people，just do yourself and feel cozy……
guillaume deschamps,5,"newly renovated gym, with new and fresh equipment. the place is packed on evening, and perhaps because this is the best gym for the monthly fee in the area. Highly recommend"
Mihály Baki,5,"A decent gym. Huge, many machines of the same type, good condition."
Mikhail Nikitin,4,Still no soap in the shower. And the pins for hanging up the towels are almost all broken.
Viktória L.,5,One of the largest gyms I have ever seen with all the machines you can imagine and the staff are really nice and helpful. Never had a problem with cleanliness! Wide variety of classes are available.
David D,1,You managed to destroy what was a decent gym with a lot of equipment. It got transformed into a walking area with machines for old people and empty space. Embarrassing!
Anna Maria Kyritsaki,3,"It is an okay gym, some of the equipment are not working (like some of the treadmills), it has a decent variety of machines, there is some (limited) space for free weights and it does *not* offer classes.

Stuff is friendly, options of memberships are very limited. For example, you can't work out without starting a binding contract that states that when you stop the membership you'll have to pay the current + the next month. That's pretty strange as in another branch I could just pay for a week of use without any strings attached.

Other than that, you can surely do your workout here but it doesn't compare to other more central/maybe more expensive gyms."
Jakob Guldberg Aaes,3,"Well it's there, pretty messy and the equipment has seen better days"
Ruman Mohammed (rumii),5,"Best every, the location is perfect."
Marian Andrei Iurcan XPREX,5,Great
Avni Hasani,2,"Okay gym, but lacking in many areas. Puregym on nørre voldgade fredericia has a lack of old and defective machines, a lack of cleaning and hand soap and the machine for all in is never filled. It is not acceptable with the 399 it costs for my type of abb"
Kristoff Green,4,Good place with proper equipment but horrible ventilation 😅 not good for summer 😅 but you can get to see nice views
Bence Nagy,4,"It's okay, has its variety but could use 1-2 more machines"
Oliver Bastholm,4,"Big with most facilities, but almost always very crowded."
Hicham JOHRA,5,Amazing place !!!
Mia Wulff,2,"Don't spend time or effort giving them constructive criticism even if they ask for clarification on the bad review of the center in their app because they are not willing to improve anything even though they claim they will do everything to improve. They just want to use long emails to basically say ""That's just how it is""... Not one of them I would train in permanently as they are pretty bad machines compared to other centers... There are others in Aalborg that are far better.."
Dimitar Bikov,1,Ever since it became Pure gym they removed all the hand sanitizer. Disgusting place
YZ L,5,"Best gym in Aalborg city center!!! I have been training in this gym 5 times per week since 2015. Compare to other fitness world gym in Aalborg city center, this one is THE BEST. Always clean everywhere - machines, bathrooms, and even the training mat! Offers a lot of equipments, and many different training classes you can choose."
Gustas Jucaitis,4,"Nice place, but can be quite crowded at times leading to extended waiting for the machine that you wish to use. The equipment itself is all good though."
Christian Segg,3,"Small for all the machines they’ve put in there. Smell of sweat due to bad AC.
Friendly staff though, and clean facilities.
Can be very crowded during holidays and weekends."
Frii,5,"Amazing gym, and most lovely staff ever!"
Carlo Bronold,4,"Have been coming here for 4-5 years. All around good gym, isn’t ever too packed, has a good amount of specifically the machines/equipment that is in high demand such as squat racks, benches, pulldown machines etc. but no fancy stuff, only “essential” standard equipment. Prices are also good for beginners but I think a little high if you’ve been training here for a while and there are no beginner benefits left."
Inna Bortnik,1,Don’t like it at all. People who work there is never there.
Gary Decsei,5,"Been a memeber for 6 years. Great gym with a large space, not fully packed with all sorts of machines, but there are still enough machines. Really love it. The music is quiet too, though it could be a bit lowered on Sundays. Still, a great palce, love coming here :)"
P Gh,1,"Despite having good machines and lovely physical space, the staff and customer service is unappealing. If you dont speak Danish, it is probable to get overcharged by mistake because some of the staff are not well-trained with the system besides having language barrier. I paid fee for extra months while my membership was supposedly on pause. They sent me bills without even sending me a notification about reactivation beforehand. At the end of the complicated way through the customer service, the result was: ""I understand you but sorry we cant do anything, you have to pay the money"". Yeah, this is sad to pay fee for months when you could have attended the gym but you were unaware.
That was by far my poorest experience of customer service in Denmark."
Yana Maksimova,4,"I train there. Not long ago they changed their machines which seem to be with less quality than the older ones.
If you want to train after work be aware that the place can be crowded. It is on convenient spot but due to that it can be also hard to finish your training on time.
It is clean and you can always clean the machines before and after usage."
matteo,5,Great for the daily grind this or another fitness world workes wonders
Przemysław Bronowicki,5,Everything I need !!! Thx
Ivan Hangstrup,5,"Always friendly staff. Cleaning is top notch. However, one could wish that men would fix their intimate shaving at home...
But nothing Fitness World can be held responsible for."
Hrvat,5,"A very nice place. Service helpful and nice. Plenty of exercise space, fitness room, nice locker room and shower. I recommend"
William Løkke,5,Really nice training center with everything you need
Roshni Chakraborty,5,This is one of the best centrres of Fitness world in Aalborg on the basis of the size and equipments
G. S.,5,"This is from PureGym on Gugvej and Friis in Aalborg. They are some good and spacious centers with a lot of machines, so you don't feel like you are stalling during your training. On Gugvej there is good parking! Nice places.🤗"
Mads Carlsen,4,"There are sometimes problems with groups of teenage boys who make noise, come in casual clothes, and are not there to train but to socialize and film videos for social media.

In addition, it is a center that is not too overcrowded, and has an OK amount of equipment for such a small center, and the surroundings are not too noisy as the premises are spread out."
Finn Thoft Jensen,3,"The training and the facilities are ok, but the last two times I've been there there has been a lack of toilet paper and/or paper towels in the men's changing room. The cleaning has not been ok either."
Mr. Riis,5,Can't find a better place
Oliver Bastholm,4,"A good, big center, with almost everything you could need."
Anita Hummelshøj Mikkelsen,5,Good service. Versatile options for training. Good mood. Room for everyone.
Oskar Korsgaard,3,"Super good service, but I think there are too few bench press racks and too few toilets, this may well cause a lot of waiting time, there could also be more water dispensers around, with this the prices also start to become too high, otherwise a fine training place."
Tobias Aarup,4,Too little space when it is busy and not enough machines. But otherwise I think there is a nice variety and the machines are in good condition
Tonni Jensen,5,The place if you want to train and be able to get to the machines. Still the place with good machines and space.
Chris Bateman,5,"Paid for a single session whilst on holiday. Was 49kr for a single or I think 100-109kr for a week.

Well equipped and big gym with friendly staff."
María Victoria Elola,5,I really like training here. Everything is clean and in good conditions. The equipment is great; there are many options. The staff is very friendly and always makes you feel comfortable.
Ivan Penchev,3,"Small and exclusive gym, One of the thing that pissed me most about it was that I wanted to use just the gym, which in all other gym from the Fitness world franchise cost 150 DKK, however this is not permitted and they require you to make a full membership for their gym and classes, even if you dont want to visit any of them, which is 250 DKK. As i said exclusive."
Zaul Tooz,4,"Good center for training, one of the original centers in Aalborg."
Zeynel Gazi,5,"This is the best fitnes. First it's close to me, second it is very big."
Afshin Loghmani M Toussi,3,"Very friendly staff.
It's one of the most expensive fitness world's centers in whole Denmark, but it's one of the most under equipped ones. You can find more equipment in lots of other cheaper centers and also the devices in this center already present in this one, either have less features or unadjusted, such as the treadmills, the scale and the rowing machines."
lleeoonn119,5,Very fine place
samira najafi,4,It's good with less variety of equipments.
Anne-Sophie Metais,5,They are trying to kill you! I guess that is the point..? :)
abhinav sekar,4,It's a fitness center. It's good.
mayquelin herrera,5,Very nice gym…. Clean and well equipped…
Reza Naeemabadi,4,You can find several training equipment for chest and shoulders in the first floor
Mughun Dev,4,A decent place to workout 👌🏼
Chris Højland,5,24 hour open
Ken Ejstrup,4,Nice place😉
Vera K,4,"I really enjoy Fitness World on Jens Baggesens vej. They have the best choice of training classes in Aarhus to my knowledge. I live in Tilst, but the Fitness World there basically has no classes at all.. maybe a handful spread over the week and often mornings.
So it is definitely worth driving to this other Fitness World with lots of evening classes and friendly staff.

The only thing is that in summer it can get very hot inside and the air is thick. So the ventilation can't keep up with the amount of people training."
Mikołaj “Złączka” Chomacki,5,They say biggest gym in scandinavia. This place is really cool! People are lovely. Can bit crowded in aftetnoons
Mika Summanen,5,Amazing cardio classes with great atmosphere!
Daran Young,5,Fantastic place to stay fit!
Thai Hiep Bui,1,"Quantity over quality, very over rated, expensive. Poor cleaning and poorly organized both from the customers and the employees. Dumbbells lying everywhere, weight bars every where on the floor, racks missing dumbbells for days is a normal thing. So many machines that are so close to each other it is impossible to move around without hitting something by accident. Not very friendly staff."
Lenka Švidrnochová,5,"Amazing gym with two floors, therefore enough space for everyone. Highly recommended for trainings in the heart of Aarhus."
suverenia,1,"Very expensive place considering that the sauna and steam bath never work properly. If the sauna is not down, then the steambath is down, and it takes months for them to fix. The steambath has currently been down for 2-3 months, and before the steambath broke down, the sauna was down for an equally long time. Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while. The bench is bent and unstable, and the walls of the sauna are getting ripped apart. And noone gives a damn.

This fitness chain took down fitnessdk and turned it into utter garbage."
John Muller,5,Excellent gym that's just recently been revamped. Has everything including full machine setups and free weights. Spacious and has a nice dressing room and sauna. Conveniently located right in the middle of town.
Jonas Elm,5,One of the best Fitness Worlds I have been in. It has a good selection of all the gear you need. Not too crowded in the morning and a major plus is that there is a sauna and a steam bath.
sachin kamble,5,Among all the centers in Aarhus. This particular center has the sauna facility. New and well designed. Can be too much crowded after 15:00 until 20:00
Luciano Andres Gino Canton Marval,1,"The balance at the gym have been broken for months, I have been waiting to weight myself and see how fat I am atm for too long"
Klemens Askjaer,4,"Has everything there needs to be at a gym but there is a bit crowded sometimes so you might have to wait in line for some things, but it's rare. Overall great gym"
Ave Nurmeots,5,One of my go-to fitness world centres in Aarhus. Lots of options and lots of space.
Exotic Lump,1,Predatory payment practices
Stinne Plesner,2,"The equipment is so worn out, the cable machines squeak and bind and there is only one lat pulldown machine. The hipthrust machine is far too tall and cannot be adjusted for women. In general, a super worn out gym and it doesn't help to paint the walls..."
Frano.0k,5,well equiped and very kind staff ☺️ always smiling
Emma H,5,"Great gym! So many good offers for memberships and lots of machines and equipment. The only negative thing I would say is that nobody is brining towels to have with them, which has usually been a requirement at gyms I go to. Therefore if people don't use the paper towels to clean you sometimes find a machine that is really sweaty and dirty and you have to clean it yourself! I think it would be nice if they changed that and asked people to bring towels for hygienic reasons. But otherwise I love the gym and would recommend! Really friendly staff too!"
Klaus Pedersen,5,"Great place to do your workout. New and always good maintained equipment, and their team activities are always with good instructors. Like most of the other Fitness World centers it's really good."
goran kozina,5,Very big space with lot of good machines in good state. Very friendly staff.
Lora Alexandrova,5,"It is my gym and I love it. Just go before 8am or after 7pm, otherwise it is super busy and you may have to even queue for machines"
павук Бодя,1,"I think I am gonna quit that GYM, the same playlist for 5 months.....It's make me crazy. No way the reason of quitting will be music.... Please change it"
bendix holtgraefe,4,"Great fitness studio with nice and helpfull staff. The only drawback is the very unflexible membership system. I'm working abroad every other month and there is no suitable membership plan for a situation like this. I'm required to pay 100 DKK everytime I want to pause my membership when starting work, which isnt very nice."
Jakub Wieczorek,4,Clean but have some old equipment that could be replaced
Klaus Pedersen,5,Great fitness center with good classes. I've been very pleased with the friendliness and professionalism among their instructors and staff. It is a place you like to work out.
Myriam D,5,"Great place, nice separation of floors, clean."
Klaus Pedersen,5,"I like this center. Great location, great opening hours and a great size. It's not too big nor to small. I primarily attend the classes and find that they have great instructors. The locker rooms are nice and clean."
Lars Steenfeldt-Gjersøe,4,"Nice fitness center, they have a lot of squat racks, free weights and cardio machines. They do lack some of the traditional machines."
Rosendal,3,"It's fine for what it is, but half the lockers can't lock properly, and the machines are quite worn down."
Nikolaj Johannes Skole Jensen,4,"One of the better fitness centers, at least in the ""Fitness World"" line-up"
Dennis Au,2,Cluttered and strangely structured center. Disabled toilet and stretcher in the same room
Maria,2,"Bad vibes! Too many people, especially at this FW is starring at you if you actually do a good job and are serious about training. To fit in, you should stare at your phone and don’t pay attention to exercise at all.. 🫤 It’s a shame.. The culture makes me change to FitnessX !!"
Antonin Fronc,5,"Clean gym with everything I need for general bodybuilding purposes. Although some equipment is visibly worn out and the gym may be crowded at times, it's not a reason to complain given the price and 05:00-24:00 opening times."
Angel Del Fabbro,2,"Really Cheap fitness chain. Nothing luxury. Nothing to make the experience better. Dated cardio machines. Everything feel old. No improvements in 10 years in technology applied to training or experience. Quite dirty, low maintenance. Dirty change rooms, not even soap in showers. Weird people hanging out but not training. Unfortunately they are like a monopoly, not other options in the city. Danes have high income but the gyms are really lame and basic compared to other countries."
Ben Brownlee,4,"A good part of the Fitness World chain of gyms. Not their biggest gym in Aarhus, but it is spacious and well laid out. There are areas for cardio, machines, circuit training, free weights and a well-placed number of squat racks. Two large rooms are available for group classes.

The recent refurb has given a well deserved refresh to the place. Staff were very attentive when we were coming out of the covid restrictions. They seem to have fallen back into old patterns since. But are generally friendly and are there to help out.

My second favourite Fitness World in Aarhus."
Gabe Avenia,3,"Gym is decent, but there is no air-conditioning in the summer which makes it just unbearable. Also no WiFi and mediocre maintenance."
Bardia Varasteh,1,"The staffs are super nice that is why I give this star for them.
But sorry that I cannot add any more stars since the center is super crowded! No matter when you go! Early morning! Evening! Week days weekends.... I think they should introduce some rule and dont accept new members since the center is too small for the people wanna to do workout! The last two times I had to just leave since I could not find any free spot to do workout!"
Lucian Constantin,2,Pretty bad compared to the other places fitness world centers I've been to in Aarhus
Tom,4,"Nice staff, clean. But missing simple things like a holder for soap in the shower, more ""cleaning stations"""
Nikolay Yurukov,5,Nice gym
Thor,5,"Clean gym, friendly staff, Working Machines"
Jonx,5,Overall a great spacious gym with many facilities
Rekai Ewan Campbell,4,Great gym with a lot of the latest equipment. Can be a bit crowded at times but never to the point that you cant work around it. They offer tours of the place so ask for one and check the place out.
Daniel Carlsson,4,Really nice gym with a lot of equipment! They have everything you need for a good training session. There can be a lot of people around 16-18.
András Tóvölgyi,2,After the pandemic I was promised to get compensated by reduced fares. It never happened and it continued to charge me with 189kr.
H,5,"Great gym, best I've tried in Aarhus for the price.
Equipment is new, clean and much nicer to use than FW - locker room is a little small"
Denis Owczynski,1,"Worst customer service and this brand is only interested in your money, they will do everything to screw you over for the smallest amount of your money."
Poul Wrist,4,"Decently equipped gym. Good amount of free weights, machines and other features."
Andreea - Madalina Balas,4,The machines are new and the stuff is very friendly and ready to assist.
Las HS,4,Wish there were some kind of security
Davor Jovanov,5,Good place to relax and get fit
Ariana-Claudia Pop,5,"What I like to this gym is that the owner always buys something new ❤️ all members are polite, they don't stare, they don't yell or moan when they exercise and everything is clean. The culture of this place is different form any other brand gym in town, it is really friendly and you can exercise in peace. It is very well equipped, there is no exercise you can't do, and is not crowded. The price is under the market price! This gym should get more 5 stars reviews. I tried it for one month and then decided to become a regular 😊"
Marck Skov,1,"Be careful; it is impossible to cancel a subscription with Infitness. Half a year after cancellation, they still send bills, despite verbally confirming the cancellation of the subscription in person at the centre on Møllevangs Allé 142."
Theodora Irava,1,"Totally disappointed!
I chose this gym because it was the cheapest from the town. Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.
When I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership. The staff is hardly speaking English.
I strongly recommend to avoid this gym."
Derrick Derby,1,Registered just yesterday and they sending me a bill. Haven't received a card yet to train. Customer service is really not cool. Disappointed already
Rosa Horcajada Capdevila,1,"I don't recommend this gym if you are an international. No English. Also, I had a lot of trouble with the payments and also to unsubscribe."
Martin Damgård Nielsen (Marhlder),2,"Great place for a casual workout. Not super clean and they are generally not very good at maintenance of their exercise machines, but most of their customers probably don't notice because they don't put on a lot of weight. I have been asking them multiple times to fix various things, but it seems everything that costs money comes at a slow place even though it seems they have plenty of customers.
Update: They think it's a good idea to turn off the lights and they no longer provide cloths for wiping the machines 👎
I think they have misunderstood the concept of inflation, raise the prices don't make the product worse..."
Magdaléna Ostárková,5,Great place for working out. Very clean
Nikolaj Johannes Skole Jensen,3,"Okay little fitness center, with a competent staff that knows what they are doing"
Panneerselvam Subramaniam,5,Wonderful GYM.
Jette Mikkelsen,5,"Nice place to train. Appreciate 2 floors.
Always friendly staff who guide in the best way"
Mohammed Al Ahmadi,2,Very small
Flex Trafik,3,"Nice place to move around a bit, unfortunately they don't have bathing facilities or treadmills 🥲"
MS B,1,"Please note that if a subscription is put on hold and later has to be terminated, you are forced to activate it and pay 1-2 months' subscription before it is terminated."
Orla Olsen,5,Good machines and great music. You really want to give it gas 😃
Martin Filtenborg,4,"No-nonsense fitness for people who don't mind all the posturing with 'the right clothes and the right drinking bottle', mirrors everywhere and whatnot."
