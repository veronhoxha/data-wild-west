I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously.","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:59PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM'}"

But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.

The most solid 3 stars you can give.

The music is a deep dark abyss that has sold more headphones than Apple sold iPhones.

The staff has always been kind and helpful except for the younger blonde girl there, who seems to hate every second of being there.

People don't have basic gym etiquette and I think the staff should really enforce it, and not stand by. So many of us would appreciate it if the staff reminded people to unrack their weights if they saw people leave them. People drop weights deadlifting 2 plates like they're Ronnie Coleman, this is another thing that the staff should address with one warning and an exit. If you can't put it down, don't pick it up.

If you're running your one rep max day, just use a platform, we're lucky enough to have two of them in a box gym.

I go off peak hours and I gotta say, I can't even begin to imagine what peak hours look like when there are so many people there off peak.

The floors are spotless some half the time, but the other half, they're disgusting.

I'm sorry, but all the people complaining in their reviews for being kicked out with outdoor shoes, go somewhere else.

Two decently sized machine halls, rowing machines and lots of cardio stuff.

Lots of weights, lots of plates but just one cable row machine.

Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

I chose this gym because it was the cheapest from the town. Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.
When I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership. The staff is hardly speaking English.
I strongly recommend to avoid this gym.","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM'}"

equipment :
there is a lot of different equipment to choose from and it mainly consists of technogym plateloaded and machines as well as cable towers and there is a good mix of new and old, which appeals to me as I am a fan and often like the old equipment best. There is a sea of ​​grips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row 🤫

Atmosphere/premises:
The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! 🥰

The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat 🫠they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odense😉","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:59PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM'}"

The staff is usually nice, although when you have a question (e.g. about billing etc.) it is all managed in a very confusing way. I do not think is their fault, but rather something related to their internal procedures and IT systems.

The classes are in Danish, but you can also find classes in English. Besides the language barriers, I find the classes useful and entertaining. Usually, the instructors are of a good level and there is quite a good variety.

The app is a welcome help for booking classes and other functions, although sometimes the user experience could be improved (and the same with the website).

------
Pretty decent gym, still missing some basic equipment here and there, but overal it’s a quite okay gym. Some problems I have with this facility:

- Only having one leg extension machine
- No proper pull-up bars with the possibility to do different grips
- Overall, too small free weight section that 9/10 times reeks of testosterone. Literally. It stinks.
- Don’t bother going on weekdays between 16:30/19:00, then your workout will last more than twice as long because of the amount of waiting on equipment and machines.
- The music in the downstairs area is way too loud most of the times. If there was a boxing class going on, fair enough, but that’s usually not the case.
- Classes that take place (and they do a lot) on the rubber matting downstairs take up a lot of space, time and equipment. I make the effort avoiding going to the gym around those times because there won’t be any equipment left to use.

Good things:
- Loads of space compared to other gyms
- Has equipment that regular (cheaper) gyms don’t have > think more CrossFit minded gym set-up
- Enough squat racks (on quiet moments of the day)
- Eleiko weight plates, we like that
- Both mens and womens barbells
- Centrally located
- People training here are more professionally minded, keep to themselves and don’t bother others > the mindset and vibe in this gym is very pleasant.

But other than that it has everything you need and it’s okay priced when you’re a student just visiting this facility. Otherwise, I would probably find a different gym.","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM'}"

Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.

While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)
The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.

All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM'}"

The only improvement I would suggest for this gym is some mirrors in the TRX area, because it is vitally important to see how your body is moving when performing TRX exercises and to see if you are keeping your body at the right position, but there is none, so you just have to guess and wait for the coach to say something or try to repeat their movement without actually being sure that you are doing it in the same way.","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM'}"

Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat).
