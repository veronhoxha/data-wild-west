But according to this manager, the head office has made a completely different decision.I spoke to the police today and made a review on the member who pushed me and threatened me which clearly can be seen on the surveillance. The manager says she has seen the video and doesn't think I'm being pushed to, but we still want to have access to the video material. Therefore, I've talked to my lawyer and we've chosen to run a case on this because of PureGym's decision.

------
Pretty decent gym, still missing some basic equipment here and there, but overal it’s a quite okay gym. Some problems I have with this facility:

- Only having one leg extension machine
- No proper pull-up bars with the possibility to do different grips
- Overall, too small free weight section that 9/10 times reeks of testosterone. Literally. It stinks.
- Don’t bother going on weekdays between 16:30/19:00, then your workout will last more than twice as long because of the amount of waiting on equipment and machines.
- The music in the downstairs area is way too loud most of the times. If there was a boxing class going on, fair enough, but that’s usually not the case.
- Classes that take place (and they do a lot) on the rubber matting downstairs take up a lot of space, time and equipment. I make the effort avoiding going to the gym around those times because there won’t be any equipment left to use.

Good things:
- Loads of space compared to other gyms
- Has equipment that regular (cheaper) gyms don’t have > think more CrossFit minded gym set-up
- Enough squat racks (on quiet moments of the day)
- Eleiko weight plates, we like that
- Both mens and womens barbells
- Centrally located
- People training here are more professionally minded, keep to themselves and don’t bother others > the mindset and vibe in this gym is very pleasant.

Equipment is broken for weeks (sometimes months) at a time. Showers work intermittently, and when down, also take weeks to fix.

Locker room has lots of almost all half size lockers (many of which are broken) and these are only half occupied even at peak times. So why not install a room of full length lockers and keep them in working order? That would cost money. Can't do that it would seem.

There was a steam room. It was closed in early 2022, supposedly due to high energy prices at the time. Never reopened. No reason given, other then the ridiculous argument that somehow, by keeping it open, the whole business would fail and the gym would then have to close down.

The staff is usually nice, although when you have a question (e.g. about billing etc.) it is all managed in a very confusing way. I do not think is their fault, but rather something related to their internal procedures and IT systems.

The classes are in Danish, but you can also find classes in English. Besides the language barriers, I find the classes useful and entertaining. Usually, the instructors are of a good level and there is quite a good variety.

It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use.

The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly.
