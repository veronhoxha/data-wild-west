And yes I do, but it's when I have nightmares.
And yes, I have tried traveling with them and will never do it again.
There was far too much ""real"" Cuba, which in reality was about the family of Yosvany (owner of the dance school) being able to come to a free party at our expense.
If people did not want to invite their dance partner out in the evening, these people were looked down upon.
And division in the group, which took the form of direct bullying of individual people in the group, nothing was done about it.
People simply behaved disgustingly towards each other and the organizer ""Cuban Dance School"" did nothing, they were more busy taking care of family matters.

Despite the wide range of levels in the teams, the dancers managed to give us all lessons at our level. There was a status meeting every morning before classes, which was a good way to align expectations and evaluate. There was a good atmosphere in the group and I have made some friends for life. We partied, danced and shared robber stories for 10 days and lived very well just behind Obispo. Yosvanny's brother made sure we always knew which groups were playing which Caasas De La Musíca. Thursdays were reserved for dancing at 1800. The included trips were great. It was a very moving experience to be at a Tambor with Yosvanny's mother who opened her home to us to give us a Cuban experience. The Cuban food was really good – especially the Cardosa. The beach trip was cool too. Dancing and bathing in the beach house was like being in a rap video. All in all, it was the best trip to Cuba I've had in my 17 years of dancing.

Dirty sheets/carpets filled with animal hair, heavily perfumed room without ventilation. Was supposed to have a 60 min massage. I think luckily she only gave me 50 minutes.
Already 20 minutes into the treatment, it seemed as if she had run through her program and was just filling in the remaining time - with strange pressures and very little overview, even though she had only taken one page. Never experienced such painful massage either. Had to remind myself to breathe several times because the pain was so intense from her massage and her movements felt incredibly stressed and fast which made it impossible to 'be' in the pain. She also massaged using a yellow tool she held in her hand, it felt like she was using a stone. Was in before lunch, and this evening my body is screaming and my muscles are cramping all the way up. Can barely move.
And then she also massaged my scalp, with oil, which then just sat in the hair, she tried to dry it, however, with a towel, which she just ran around my hair - perhaps would have liked to know, I should have had a brush with me, since at least I didn't leave the room in a presentable way.
And then she complained quite a lot about downtown - despite the fact that she herself has chosen to make an offer through them.

- The exhaust in our bathroom did not work well. After taking a hot bath, it seemed like whole room was dipped in water.

- We told the staff but nobody helped in our 4-day stay. They said they would but did not.

I guess, the experience depends on the room. Our room had all the problems listed above. But maybe other rooms don't. But I can surely say that I won't spend this much money to try again. I would even pay more to get other very good hotels nearby. Bye bye DGI Byens.",1.0,OTHER

It's quite sad to pay a lot of money and then have a daughter who cries every or every other Thursday because the swimming pool is closed.

I have contacted them several times and suggested that they get an agreement with the municipality that swimmers can then go to one of the municipality's other halls.

However, this was without result, as they point fingers at the municipality, the municipality points fingers at HSK if you contact them, and that is where you stand as parents of a crying girl.

A bill, a crying child and hsk and the municipality that cannot find a solution for a closed pool.",1.0,OTHER

The changing room was clean and well kept. A different approach where you change in a booth and a large communal area to hang your clothes. Works well and saves lots of space. Leaving valuable in the locker room felt very safe.
The room was heated to a very comfortable temperature. Note that the class I attended was a workshop and not a traditional hot yoga class. The room was cozy with plants, music, and soft lighting.

It's quite sad to pay a lot of money and then have a daughter who cries every or every other Thursday because the swimming pool is closed.

I have contacted them several times and suggested that they get an agreement with the municipality that swimmers can then go to one of the municipality's other halls.

However, this was without result, as they point fingers at the municipality, the municipality points fingers at HSK if you contact them, and that is where you stand as parents of a crying girl.

At the very first consultation I was given exercises that included bending and stretching forward. This surprised me as bending forward was the one thing my orthopedic surgeon told me to avoid doing as it can potentially lead to another prolapse.
Luckily I didn’t do it and double checked with the orthopedic doctor who confirmed this is likely to cause harm so soon after surgery.

I shared the feedback with Mathias who treated me and he unfortunately waved it off with the argument that the surgeon likely got it wrong as he is probably not up to date on pain management and training.

Both the treatment itself and the reaction to my feedback was very disappointing and based on this I cannot recommend Elitefysio.

Overall, I did not feel any significant or long lasting relief and have spent quite a big sum of money and have eventually stopped going after experiencing worsening of my symptoms.

I had a 50th birthday party for my wife with 60 guests and we had the best party for a long time, in their fantastic rooms in the fireplace room.
We chose their table share menu and both fish dishes and vegans were catered for. Many of our guests have responded to how delicious both the food and wine were.
The tables were beautifully decorated in the really nice and stylish room, with a parquet floor and chandeliers. The coffee was served in the cozy fireplace room, while space was made for a dance floor in the hall. Perfect with two rooms so you can sit and talk in between, a bit of peace for music and the dance floor. I think it made many people stay a little longer than usual.
In a busy everyday life, it was really nice to hold a party where others take care of all the practical things from table setting, decorations, serving staff to clean-up and cleaning.

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

Unfortunately, some personal items were removed from my room during my stay.  I was credited 500DKK which was a kind gesture but I was still concerned about potentially broken protocols or policies that needed to be revisited.  For example, I had the Do Not Disturb (DND) sign on the door but housekeeping still entered.  Also, there was a camera over my door which apparently showed all activity at my door throughout the day and night.  I was promised I could see the video of footage during the day my items went missing but due to a communication issue among staff, the video was deleted before I had an opportunity to see it.

I reached out to the front office manager, who I worked with from the start of the incident, and the director to try to get two concerns addressed: 1) If housekeeping still enters the room to empty the trash when the DND sign is on the door, please inform guests so they know what the DND sign means at Charlottehaven, and, 2)  I suggested that when there is an incident under investigation, it would be good to have a protocol in place to retain the video that may useful in the investigation for longer than the default 3-day period.  Note: I reached out a few times to see the video before the 3-day expiration.

In an attempt to resolve my concerns before posting this review, I reached out to resolve or at least receive acknowledgement of the underlying issues needing attention related to my experience with invasion of privacy.  I have not received a response despite the fact that I was promised a response from the office manager on two separate occasions.

I sincerely hope my experience was and will remain a one-off situation.",3.0,OTHER

Such a wonderful place, with so many people of all ages and nationalities. Come and eat, and maybe meet a new friend. The food was really good, and we even got a dessert. The drinks you pay for separately at the bar. The concept of the place is, you decide who from the table goes to get the food (8-person table) after your meal you gathered the plates and return them to the bar. Then dessert. It works, and everyone seems happy, so try it if you feel the need to be social and you are hungry. Great concept",4.0,OTHER

This place is a gem of Copenhagen! From a wide variety of social activities to delicious food offers and engaging kids' activities, they truly offer it all.

The water is clean and a great temp and it wasn’t too busy when I visited in the morning (1-2 people per lane). The locker room felt a bit older, but was generally in good shape.

Like the other public pools in Denmark that I’ve visited, there’s no front desk. You just buy your swim pass from a machine in the front (credit cards accepted) and get a wristband. You’re required to shower before putting on your swimsuit, and everyone seemed to comply. Lockers are free to use and automated (you just put a pin on the screen to open/close)—no need to bring your own lock.

Overall, great neighborhood pool to swim laps.",4.0,OTHER

That is for the times where it’s open to the public - it’s best to check the website (as some times it’s booked for clubs or associations).

It can get busy at some hours. The good part is that you can check how busy it is from outside (so you can decide if you skip the swim in case it’s too full).

There are lockers in the changing rooms. They work with a code (so no coin or lock is required).

There are lifeguards on duty in the side of the pool. The access is done with an automated payment machine in the entrance (you can pay by credit card or mobile pay), which dispenses a self-adhesive bracelet that serves as ticket.

There is also an infrared sauna (temporarily closed in the winter of 2022 due to the energy prices and electricity availability).",4.0,OTHER

Everything was clean and I felt safe and happy. A nice feature is the view on the street and the trees there.

I pretty much got my injury under control. However, I found that my physical therapist could not remember what injury I had and I had to repeat several times what exercises he had given me. I understand that there can be a degree of uncertainty in relation to diagnosis, but the programming itself lacked clear structure and seemed haphazard.

There were times when he was surprised that I was still doing certain exercises. When the course was completed, I was simply advised to ""try my way"" without a clearly defined plan on how to get back to my previous level. Despite the 7 sessions, the therapist had neglected to look at my body as a whole, resulting in an imbalance as I had overcompensated for a long period of time. I later ended up going to another physiotherapist who diagnosed a secondary injury that I am now struggling with.

Dirty sheets/carpets filled with animal hair, heavily perfumed room without ventilation. Was supposed to have a 60 min massage. I think luckily she only gave me 50 minutes.
Already 20 minutes into the treatment, it seemed as if she had run through her program and was just filling in the remaining time - with strange pressures and very little overview, even though she had only taken one page. Never experienced such painful massage either. Had to remind myself to breathe several times because the pain was so intense from her massage and her movements felt incredibly stressed and fast which made it impossible to 'be' in the pain. She also massaged using a yellow tool she held in her hand, it felt like she was using a stone. Was in before lunch, and this evening my body is screaming and my muscles are cramping all the way up. Can barely move.
And then she also massaged my scalp, with oil, which then just sat in the hair, she tried to dry it, however, with a towel, which she just ran around my hair - perhaps would have liked to know, I should have had a brush with me, since at least I didn't leave the room in a presentable way.
And then she complained quite a lot about downtown - despite the fact that she herself has chosen to make an offer through them.

I had an appointment with you on Friday 16/8 at 11 am - I have both the confirmations of my appointment by email and receipts from shops I was in on Fisketorvet immediately afterwards.

But where am I supposed to train? There is this small area for floor workouts where 2 people (max) fit, if doing jumping jacks, burpees or similar. No place to combine jumping, weights and floor exercises. You should also put a few pairs of small barbels upstairs, so I don't need to go to another universe to fetch pair of 3kg weights. It is also super hot inside, which is weird since it is below 0 degrees these days in Copenhagen. I was told that summer is unbearable.

I recently had my last temporary job at Fælledgården. It is to my great regret that I even agreed to begin with.
I have NEVER experienced such incompetence from nursing home management.
Hanna and Bettina should NEVER have had the positions they hold. The 2 in particular treat several of their permanent employees and not least their replacements as slaves. They overburden their permanent employees/substitutes and demand that they can multitask and be in several places at the same time, and the corona situation only makes it even more chaotic. The majority of the responsibility for those affected by the corona falls on the house's replacements and temps rather than the permanent employees.
I would also like to mention here the completely insane corona restrictions that they set up for their employees and which, by the way, are not seen anywhere else. They require a mask or visor upon arrival at Fælledgården and in all the common areas and in the residents' homes. These requirements can of course be both accepted and respected to a certain extent.
Furthermore, the staff may only eat and drink in the offices and all belongings must be stored either in the wardrobes in the basement or in the office. It could also easily be accepted if only the management itself complied with all these rules and requirements. The center manager can, for example, is seen walking around with his cup of coffee throughout the house without a mask or visor, where is the justice in that?? But there is apparently a hierarchy which acquits the boss and other higher employees of such regulations. The worst part, however, is that it goes beyond the residents who live in the wards where the chaos is clearly noticeable.

There are creative activities you can take part in, for example making things for the house's Christmas bazaar. You can eat cheaply in the cafe and you don't have to eat alone at home.

All the trainers are great and accomodate the sessions in both English and Danish. I had PT sessions with Niko alongside the Hiit classes and have really enjoyed it. Over the last 4 months Niko has really helped me with training, strength building and losing weight. I am feeling a lot more confident and body positive. Training with Niko has been fun and really rewarding, he helped with meal plans and I'm lifting weights I never thought was possible for me.

Highly recommend the sessions for all levels from beginner to advanced.

As I hadn't worked out for several months prior, I ended up overexerting myself and was hospitalized with a severe case of rhabdomyolysis, which, if not treated, can cause kidney failure. This wasn't the studio's fault, although I feel that the class I went to was too intense for something aimed at newbies. I emailed them afterwards to inform them that I had been hospitalized. I also suggested to them that in the future they might consider warning beginners of the well-documented risks of high-intensity workouts and easing them more slowly into HIIT. However, I received no reply, which seems rather unprofessional.

The instructors are friendly and encouraging, but if you're not used to high-intensity workouts, be aware of the risks and don't push yourself overly hard.",3.0,OTHER

(Could have just moved him somewhere else😥 ) and a single talented boy, my boy's age. My boy was of course shy, but really tried his best, there was no help from the dance teacher Mark (who, before they started, said that I could just come and try out on Monday, because it was a boys' team, even though it said Tuesday junior team) but only attention"" to the others. NOT very pedagogical style, when all children who have to dance for the first time between strangers and other big children probably needed support and a little praise, then the desire to try again ,would be reinforced. My boy struggled with inexperience and I had to PRAISE HIM all evening and the next day to boost his confidence. My boy otherwise has a good approach to all new things. I imagine how a slightly shy child must have that in the same situation😔 only one star, and hope their attitude improves🙏",1.0,OTHER

But paid for two lessons more than I could achieve as the month was already half way through. Only managed 4 dance hours, then I was on holiday, so I got a few hours in. Then corona happened. Since they reopened, I have been on sick leave and hospitalized, so have not been able to catch up on the dance lessons that I am entitled to, as I have paid for half a year's worth of lessons.

Called in and explained my situation. But was just told it wasn't their problem. They may be right about that. But I think it would have been good style and customer service to just give me half of my lessons for good or similar.

The course consisted of a well-thought-out combination of light exercise and movement for use before and during birth, education in the phases of birth, breathing methods, labor, rest and pressure positions, breastfeeding and the time after birth, as well as group discussions about challenges, both physical and mental during the pregnancy and in relation to the birth.
It worked really well for me that the partners were there twice, as well as being part of a group where you can reflect on challenges and worries and thus feel ""normal"".

Rarely, if ever, have I experienced such a cozy and nice atmosphere among the employees and users (myself included). I have had (and have) great pleasure from the booty strength class, which physiotherapist student Sarah holds every Monday. I have learned a great deal in the team, and she is incredibly thorough and skilled at guiding and giving advice and guidance. I have also had a few private training sessions with Karim who also provides the best guide and is extremely good at what he does! It is such a pleasure to be met by such friendly staff, and then you get some fantastic teammates on the teams you participate in. At least on the ones I've trained on. I can also recommend the calisthenics class on Wednesdays, which Jens organizes. He really does that very well, and you are really taken by the hand, despite the fact that some of the exercises seem impossible, you really find out that the body can do more than you think. Huge kudos to him too!
Brønshøj fit&sund can really be proud and happy of their employees, because they do a fantastic job to make the atmosphere in the center fantastic. I really love coming there, because you get in a really good mood, and the training facilities are also just tip top! Big praise to you, from a very satisfied user. :-)
