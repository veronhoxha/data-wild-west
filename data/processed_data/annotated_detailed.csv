207,"Big gym spanning 3 floors. Good selection of benches and power racks. All equipment is of the lowest quality possible (Technogym) and has clearly been compromised to maximize profits. This lack of care for traning quality also becomes strenghtend by obscure rules, such as backpacks/gymbags or similar being forbidden in the gym.

There is a sea of ​​grips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row 🤫Atmosphere/premises:The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! 🥰Service:The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat 🫠they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odense😉",4.0,PureGym,1.0,1.0,1.0,,

Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat). And I really like the 'freestyle' courses like Crossfit and Functional, because they include different equipments and are usually with only a few people so the trainer can focus on you.

260,"The gym is great, spacious and has everything, and the personel is friendly and helpful.However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use.

If there was a boxing class going on, fair enough, but that’s usually not the case.- Classes that take place (and they do a lot) on the rubber matting downstairs take up a lot of space, time and equipment. I make the effort avoiding going to the gym around those times because there won’t be any equipment left to use.Good things:- Loads of space compared to other gyms- Has equipment that regular (cheaper) gyms don’t have > think more CrossFit minded gym set-up- Enough squat racks (on quiet moments of the day)- Eleiko weight plates, we like that- Both mens and womens barbells- Centrally located- People training here are more professionally minded, keep to themselves and don’t bother others > the mindset and vibe in this gym is very pleasant.But other than that it has everything you need and it’s okay priced when you’re a student just visiting this facility.

398,"While it is spacious and with the ability to brag about a wide variety of equipment, the standard of several machines, is low. Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now.

It often breaks, and stays broken for long periods of time, and has been closed for over a year and a half as of summer of 2023. No idea why they can't keep this running. There was also a missing plank in the sauna bench that took over 6 months to fix.

The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open).

The police came and interrogated us both. The police closed the case (three days ago 23/10/23 and didn't want to look at the surveillance and estimated that there were no threats or the like. But according to this manager, the head office has made a completely different decision.I spoke to the police today and made a review on the member who pushed me and threatened me which clearly can be seen on the surveillance. The manager says she has seen the video and doesn't think I'm being pushed to, but we still want to have access to the video material. Therefore, I've talked to my lawyer and we've chosen to run a case on this because of PureGym's decision.

129,"(the review is written after 8 visits to the center over a period of two months. In addition, I have a roommate who uses the center considerably more often, who has the same experience)There is a lack of general management of the center, otherwise it wouldn't be so wrong... There is a consistent lack of hand alcohol in half of dispensations. - All toilets are grossly disgusting. It is immediately similar that no toilets are checked more than 2-3 times a day, which is absurd when you think about the amount of people using the centerStaff should go round every hour in peak hours, but rarely move from the desk, even when there are more at work. In addition, the toilets smell rancid, suggesting a lack of ground cleaning (other than emptying trash can and cleaning mirror) - no water vending machines, which means that you are forced into disgusting toilets to fill your water bottle. - More cabinets in the men's dressing rooms do not work, which means that it can be difficult to find a closet when you have to work out in busy peIt is absurd to take so much money in continuous when the booth at the center is so poor. For example, rope for cable maxins is falling apart. Many cable racks do not work due to lack of carabine hanger or other relatively small bugs that should be easily solved. One toilet door in the men's changing room has been missing a lock for almost 2 months. The same applies to the light in the sauna.
