PureGym,Lewis Atkins,2,"Just a very bad gym. Staff don’t really care, don’t blame them tbh it’s miserable in here. All-in deal is bad value. Lots of equipment but the space is pretty sad and windowless",Google
PureGym,Eric,1,"terrible facilities
bathrooms are gross, dirty and smelly
people who live on the streets nearby sneak in the bathrooms and constantly use them, leaving a mess
do not recommend joining this place
the arcade to get to the gym is packed with people sleeping on the floor, feels unsafe and dirty",Google
PureGym,Rune Perstrup,1,"An Unhygienic Coronavirus Petri Dish.

I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously.",Google
PureGym,Mario Piazza,1,"In a huge gym there is only one hair dryer and it’s not working. I asked the staff to fix it one week ago and they told me they will replace it immediately. Today still the same problem and it’s even dangerous as the wire is open. I told the staff guy that I suffered from sinusitis and have to blow my long hair. I even asked him to give me the one in the women’s changing room for few minutes. He said the hair dryer is fixed. When I asked him how is it possible that in such a huge gym there is no other hair dryer, he told me that they didn’t bring the new hair dryer yet and there is no other one. Unacceptable.",Google
PureGym,Mark Saraira,1,"If it possible to give 0 star a will, i cancel my membership and tell the staff in the gym that i gonna move to another city, the say ok but the money for February we cannot give it to you back(i train 1 time in February), i say ok just cancel me member the say ok, now 01.03.2023 the received from my card again 239 for nothing!!, i’am in another city i cant go to the gym and they still received from my card money, stupid rules and the manager who say to me in February you will not pay anymore is lier. I will never ever update my membership again in your gym, (take my money for nothing).",Google
PureGym,Angi Las,1,"The Studio is not in best Shape. As Many before me wrote: it’s very small, the devices are packed!! Could be a lot cleaner - especially the toilets.
But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.
Will go to another fitness world studio in the future and hope that the next one will be more modern and clean und the staff maybe a little more educated.",Google
PureGym,Daniel Storm,2,"Watch out! In the mens changing rooms there are someone unscrewing the locks so they can open the lockers even if you have your own lock on.

This has been a big problem over the last year. And Fitness World do not inform you about this!!!!",Google
PureGym,Eduardo Simões,1,"Attention! I have noticed some screws missing in the locks of the locker room (males). This allows the door to be opened even with a lock. Always choose a locker with screws as the screws cannot be removed with a lock on. Also, booking system is problematic.",Google
PureGym,Navid Mosadeghi,5,It’s clean and well equipped.,Google
PureGym,Carlos Olivo,5,Very nice gym. I got a week pass for 110 dkk or something like that wich is really surprisingly cheap for this quality gym. You can also do daily passes. The only thing to bear in mind that after 6pm and on the weekends there is no one to check you in so come before if you want to singup and then you can use the gym using a card until midnight.,Google

PureGym,Sharad Govil,5,Great Gym- I was a bit nervous as this is my first time to a gym in Denmark but the front staff was very friendly and helpful. For 99DKK I could get a pass for a week. It opens from 5:30 AM to 10:00 PM. The timing showed in google is when front staff is available. You need an access card to enter so if you are first times from overseas go after 8:00 AM so staff can open the door for you.,Google

PureGym,Mikkel Thygesen,3,"Good facilities, but it is in dire need of better climate control. It's only about 19c outside now but the inside the gym is burning (when doing workouts obviously). The group hall is even worse because they're not allowed to open the windows.",Google
PureGym,Christian Haugbølle,1,"Signed up and regretted my subscription within the 14 days cancellation period. I had a very, very hard time getting them to understand that I should not pay for the rest of the month + 1 month if I cancelled within 14 days (they even asked if I had actually READ their terms, which I had ... and turned out their center-leader had not, which was very awkward for her). I can't recommend Fitness World.",Google

PureGym,Viktor Y,3,"TL;DR: Music sucks, most staff good, sometimes spotless and sometimes dirty. No enforcement of basic gym etiquette. Gym is probably a bit too busy. A true to size 3 stars.

The most solid 3 stars you can give.

The music is a deep dark abyss that has sold more headphones than Apple sold iPhones.

The staff has always been kind and helpful except for the younger blonde girl there, who seems to hate every second of being there.

People don't have basic gym etiquette and I think the staff should really enforce it, and not stand by. So many of us would appreciate it if the staff reminded people to unrack their weights if they saw people leave them. People drop weights deadlifting 2 plates like they're Ronnie Coleman, this is another thing that the staff should address with one warning and an exit. If you can't put it down, don't pick it up.

If you're running your one rep max day, just use a platform, we're lucky enough to have two of them in a box gym.

I go off peak hours and I gotta say, I can't even begin to imagine what peak hours look like when there are so many people there off peak.

The floors are spotless some half the time, but the other half, they're disgusting.

I'm sorry, but all the people complaining in their reviews for being kicked out with outdoor shoes, go somewhere else.

Two decently sized machine halls, rowing machines and lots of cardio stuff.

Lots of weights, lots of plates but just one cable row machine. I'd upgrade my membership if there were decent classes; like yoga, HIIT or boxing during normal employed human hours (before work or after work)",Google
PureGym,Aleksandar Maricak,3,Relative okay gym. Matrix machines are not the best and the Nautilus were better before renovation. Dumbbells are not put in the correct location and it is always overcrowded. Not enough machines compared to the demand.,Google
PureGym,Type One Fitness,1,They changed the cost of a guest fee from 50kr to 69kr and the new Matrix equipment is so so so uncomfortable. Since PureGym took over this place it is easily the worst gym in Østerbro!,Google

All are kept well maintained and on a leash if necessary. According to rumors, there are also classes for different things but I don't know anything about that.

PureGym,Ewa Palenta-Rusin,2,"I give 1 star more than #fitnessworld actually deserves for the great ""hold"" instructors. Otherwise it is a poor service fitness center that want to rip you off at every turn. I got a special offer when I signed up because it was FW birthday - ""All-in"" free for one month. It was the end of month and I did not get to use it at all. But to my big astonishment, it was an opt-in subscription service, so I was actually billed for the next month without even being notified beforehand! I cancelled it right away but I had to pay for that month anyway. So I used it a few times. And here comes the next surprise - again I was billed for the product I ""bought"" on top of my monthly fee.
I am asking, is that what a reputable fitness chain do? I doubt..",Google

PureGym,Mikhail Nikitin,1,"One can talk about broken machines or dirt in the changing rooms, but I realize that things can't be ideal all the time. So I'd say it all goes relatively well until one needs to talk to someone beyond the helping guys in the centre. The company doesn't have a phone number to call. They have a chat, which main purpose seems to relay a message ""Fill in the online contact form"". When you do, there is a waiting time from hours to days. And if you get an answer, it never changes regardless whether you can prove them wrong or lying. They merely stop responding. And there's nothing you can say to someone who is not willing to listen.",Google
PureGym,Huttan T. L,1,"As someone who have been in all FW's in Copenhagen, this place is by far the most horrid. Rude staff who seems like they hate their life. They lack a total grasp on how to give service (Talking ESPECIALLY the female ones). There is also ZERO atmosphere and place is very dirty and STINKS  utterly on each of its three (Small) floors . Just find another place than this, because this place is so outrageously bad it drains you from all motivation. Not exaggerating.",Google
PureGym,Lisa Apers,3,"Okay, it would however be really nice to have an indicator somewhere of how crowded it is.

PureGym,Mathias Moslund,5,Good gym!,Google
PureGym,Krzysztof Turczyn,4,"This place is great!
They have all you need and they're open 24 hours, if it was even a bit dirty it's because lazy members do not know how to behave! People working there are trainers and office staff they are not your slave and they are not there to clean you mess! But there is one thing that drives me crazy and I was trying to ignore it but it is a bit hard now... the music when the staff leaves. If any staff employee of FW is reading it, can you PLEASE contact the staff in this gym and asked them to when they leave at 8 PM maybe set some radio or some motivational music? There was this one day that the song got stuck it was play allllllllllll night long, the same one song, and it was not even a good one, and literally after 40 mins I left coz not even my headphones helped. And yesterday there was some country music. In general after 8 there is always ""not the best music"" and I think if it's like this I'd prefer to work out in silence.

PureGym,P-A M.,3,"I've worked out in three different gyms in Copenhagen and this one was clearly the worst. There aren't enough showers in the men's locker rooms and they are incredibly wastefull in water. Another low point is the door system letting you in the gym, which keeps denying you the entrance if you're not perfectly positioned inside the cabin - too much fuss for nothing. Also, there are many annoying teenagers that aren't there for serious training, they're loud and using the equipment for fun while other people want to go on with their workout.

Otherwise the amenities for the workout per se are good and various.",Google
PureGym,Jonas Vilkevicius,1,"Service has improved for the last 6 months, better management.

PureGym,Geraint Nott,2,"A lot of young people go to this gym, and don't appreciate or follow gym etiquette. Often leaving weights where they use them, don't clean the machines after use and often sit for a long time looking at their phones. The gym is not staffed all the time and so no one tells these children to clean up after themselves.

Otherwise the gym is fine with modern and working machines. It can be a little cramped in some areas where the free weights are used, but this wouldn't be a problem if people were not so entitled and treated it like their personal gym.",Google
PureGym,Mike Martins,1,"The average age of the members in this gym must be somewhere around 17/18 at the most. Its pretty close to a folkeskole, hence you'll find alot of kids and teenagers in this gym.They come in large groups and take all the space (in an already very small gym) by basically playing around, acting like they're at a playground.

PureGym,RUECKENWIND,1,"I'm shocked after reading reviews that are just 3 years old (urban gym) compared to today. Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

The only good thing are the other people, most of them are friendly. The gym itself is just disgusting and not worth the money. That's just the review for that certain location.",Google

PureGym,Anna Maria Kyritsaki,3,"It is an okay gym, some of the equipment are not working (like some of the treadmills), it has a decent variety of machines, there is some (limited) space for free weights and it does *not* offer classes.

Stuff is friendly, options of memberships are very limited. For example, you can't work out without starting a binding contract that states that when you stop the membership you'll have to pay the current + the next month. That's pretty strange as in another branch I could just pay for a week of use without any strings attached.

PureGym,P Gh,1,"Despite having good machines and lovely physical space, the staff and customer service is unappealing. If you dont speak Danish, it is probable to get overcharged by mistake because some of the staff are not well-trained with the system besides having language barrier. I paid fee for extra months while my membership was supposedly on pause. They sent me bills without even sending me a notification about reactivation beforehand. At the end of the complicated way through the customer service, the result was: ""I understand you but sorry we cant do anything, you have to pay the money"". Yeah, this is sad to pay fee for months when you could have attended the gym but you were unaware.
That was by far my poorest experience of customer service in Denmark.",Google
PureGym,Yana Maksimova,4,"I train there. Not long ago they changed their machines which seem to be with less quality than the older ones.

It is clean and you can always clean the machines before and after usage.",Google

PureGym,suverenia,1,"Very expensive place considering that the sauna and steam bath never work properly. If the sauna is not down, then the steambath is down, and it takes months for them to fix. The steambath has currently been down for 2-3 months, and before the steambath broke down, the sauna was down for an equally long time. Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while. The bench is bent and unstable, and the walls of the sauna are getting ripped apart. And noone gives a damn.

This fitness chain took down fitnessdk and turned it into utter garbage.",Google

The only negative thing I would say is that nobody is brining towels to have with them, which has usually been a requirement at gyms I go to.

I chose this gym because it was the cheapest from the town. Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.
When I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership. The staff is hardly speaking English.
I strongly recommend to avoid this gym.",Google

PureGym,Frederik Sandberg,4,"Bondovej gym has been my regular and favorite gym for the last 2 years. Primarily because, in my opinion, it is the best pure gym center in this part of Odense🙃

equipment :
there is a lot of different equipment to choose from and it mainly consists of technogym plateloaded and machines as well as cable towers and there is a good mix of new and old, which appeals to me as I am a fan and often like the old equipment best. There is a sea of ​​grips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row 🤫

Atmosphere/premises:
The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! 🥰

Service:
The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat 🫠they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odense😉",Google

The voice echo from the women's bathroom loud as it gets and everyone from the men's room can hear everything. Not sure if the management have notice it.

SATS,C L,5,5-star rating for the second floor lounge. I was running around the park 630am and needed a bathroom and a coffee. SATS is perfect for just that. I didn’t try the gym. Neither do I see the point of paying for cardio machine when you are so close to a beautiful park in summertime.,Google
SATS,Guido Nap,3,"The gym is ok, although with rising prices I guess it became a bit expensive for what it offers. It is a bit small but very modern and fairly clean. At least more than other gyms I have seen in Copenhagen. It is often packed when it comes to using the barbell stations but definitely, I have seen it worse.

The staff is usually nice, although when you have a question (e.g. about billing etc.) it is all managed in a very confusing way. I do not think is their fault, but rather something related to their internal procedures and IT systems.

The classes are in Danish, but you can also find classes in English. Besides the language barriers, I find the classes useful and entertaining. Usually, the instructors are of a good level and there is quite a good variety.

The app is a welcome help for booking classes and other functions, although sometimes the user experience could be improved (and the same with the website).

I am still a client and I think the gym has the potential though to become even better. It depends on what the management will make out of it.",Google

Personally, I feel like this is one of the better, if you just want to get in and do a workout and get out. You'll rarely wait for a spot anywhere.

They have everything you need including 6 squat racks / power cages and a bunch of free weight stuff, cardio machines. The only thing lacking is team workout.

bad service, and if you are going to train with your partner or friends who know something more than you in the world of fitness

SATS,Dan Leonhardt,2,"General vibe bad. Situation seems like: ""We know we're not going to renew this lease, so let's put in the minimum effort and money and keep the place open."" They really should clean the equipment better, and more frequently, than they do.

You've only got about a 75% chance that the steam room is working in the men's lockers (and this was before they made up the lame excuse of energy cost). It often breaks, and stays broken for long periods of time, and has been closed for over a year and a half as of summer of 2023. No idea why they can't keep this running. There was also a missing plank in the sauna bench that took over 6 months to fix. So, maintenance is pretty bad all around.

Note that sometimes they do classes out on the gym floor on the second level. So you're somewhat constrained when that happens, and you best like the music they are playing or you'll want to be on the ground floor instead.",Google

SATS,Dan Leonhardt,2,"Wasted potential. This could be a good gym, but their obvious desire to minimize spending really hurts the customer experience.

Equipment is broken for weeks (sometimes months) at a time. Showers work intermittently, and when down, also take weeks to fix.

Locker room has lots of almost all half size lockers (many of which are broken) and these are only half occupied even at peak times. So why not install a room of full length lockers and keep them in working order? That would cost money. Can't do that it would seem.

There was a steam room. It was closed in early 2022, supposedly due to high energy prices at the time. Never reopened. No reason given, other then the ridiculous argument that somehow, by keeping it open, the whole business would fail and the gym would then have to close down.

And the minimal staffing means there's nobody to enforce the rules (CLEAN THE MACHINE WHEN YOU ARE DONE!) or do little things like fill up soap dispensers in the bathrooms and showers.",Google

But where am I supposed to train? There is this small area for floor workouts where 2 people (max) fit, if doing jumping jacks, burpees or similar. No place to combine jumping, weights and floor exercises. You should also put a few pairs of small barbels upstairs, so I don't need to go to another universe to fetch pair of 3kg weights.

The young guys and girls at the counter really need to be taught how to provide good customer service because their condesending attitude is not affecting the outlook of the gym in a positive way...
------
Pretty decent gym, still missing some basic equipment here and there, but overal it’s a quite okay gym. Some problems I have with this facility:

- Only having one leg extension machine
- No proper pull-up bars with the possibility to do different grips
- Overall, too small free weight section that 9/10 times reeks of testosterone. Literally. It stinks.
- Don’t bother going on weekdays between 16:30/19:00, then your workout will last more than twice as long because of the amount of waiting on equipment and machines.
- The music in the downstairs area is way too loud most of the times. If there was a boxing class going on, fair enough, but that’s usually not the case.
- Classes that take place (and they do a lot) on the rubber matting downstairs take up a lot of space, time and equipment. I make the effort avoiding going to the gym around those times because there won’t be any equipment left to use.

Good things:
- Loads of space compared to other gyms
- Has equipment that regular (cheaper) gyms don’t have > think more CrossFit minded gym set-up
- Enough squat racks (on quiet moments of the day)
- Eleiko weight plates, we like that
- Both mens and womens barbells
- Centrally located
- People training here are more professionally minded, keep to themselves and don’t bother others > the mindset and vibe in this gym is very pleasant.

But other than that it has everything you need and it’s okay priced when you’re a student just visiting this facility. Otherwise, I would probably find a different gym.",Google

SATS,R Lu,2,"While it is spacious and with the ability to brag about a wide variety of equipment, the standard of several machines, is low. Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.

While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)
The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.

All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.",Google

Changing rooms have 2 saunas that work all the time also there is a discount for the membership for the students+ staff is really friendly. I do not speak Danish, so in some classes I just let the coach know and the problem is solved. The only improvement I would suggest for this gym is some mirrors in the TRX area, because it is vitally important to see how your body is moving when performing TRX exercises and to see if you are keeping your body at the right position, but there is none, so you just have to guess and wait for the coach to say something or try to repeat their movement without actually being sure that you are doing it in the same way.",Google

Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat). And I really like the 'freestyle' courses like Crossfit and Functional, because they include different equipments and are usually with only a few people so the trainer can focus on you.

Godt sted trækker mange mennesker (medlemmer) til. Hagen herved er, at i ""myldertrafikken"" (i tidsrummet 16:30-19:00) er centret ofte meget tæt ""befolket""; det kan være en smule irriterende, især hvis man anvender centrets styrketrænings-maskiner, som ofte kan være optaget.Med dette aber dabei, må centret nøjes med 4 pæne stjerner.Mvh.

Men der sker ingen forbedring, og de skylder bare på at de ikke ejer bygningen selv, og at bygningsejere ikke tillader udluftning. Der har været virkelig dårlig luft i en måned nu, og det er simpelthen for dårligt for et fitnesscenter. Luftkvaliteten betyder altså ret meget når man står på løbebånd. Her er der behov for en hurtig løsning, for det er virkeligt hårdt at ville tage afsted til træning i det indeklima.Redigeret efter svar:Centerledelsen, de ansatte og puregym centralt er allerede kontaktet flere gange i løbet af oktober.

Intet problem tænker jeg, for jeg ved jo at der altid er personale som gør rent og fylder vare op mv., som må kunne hjælpe stakkels mig. En personlig træner står bag kassen og tager imod min besked, og går ned til personalet som er igang med rengøringen nedenunder. To minutter senere kommer han tilbage og meddeler, at det kan de desværre ikke hjælpe med da de først betjener kunder fra kl 8, så jeg kunne lige vente en time.

PureGym,Avni Hasani,1,"Jeg har i dag forsøgt at træne i PureGym Vejlevej, Fredericia. Mit kort er blevet spæret grundet en situation som skete for 3 dage siden. Jeg kunne forstå på manageren som var på arbejde i dag (26/10/23 kl. 13.30) at hovedkontoret har besluttet at bandlyse mig i 2 år for trusler hvilket er løgn. Manageren sagde desuden at der ikke er lyd på overvågningen men at jeg har truet en af medlemmerne Den rigtige version er at, jeg blev skubbet og truet af et medlem som tydeligt er på steroider i PureGym. Han var igang med at bruge 2 maskiner (Tårne med kabler) og jeg tog selvfølgelig den han ikke var igang med, men da jeg konfronterede ham med reglerne gik  han amok over han ikke måtte bruge begge maskiner på samme tid. Han skubbede mig væk og truet mig voldsomt. Politiet kom og afhørte os begge. Politiet lukkede sagen (for 3 dage siden 23/10/23 og ville ikke se på overvågningen og vurderet at der ikke var tale om trusler eller lign. Men ifølge denne manager har hovedkontoret taget en helt anden beslutning.Derfor har jeg talt med politiet i dag og lavet en anmeldelse på det medlem som skubbet mig og truet mig som tydeligt kan ses på overvågningen. Manageren siger hun har set videoen og synes ikke jeg bliver skubbet til, men vi vil alligevel gerne have adgang til det video materiale. Derfor har jeg talt med min advokat og vi har valgt at køre en sag på dette grundet PureGym's beslutning. Manageren sagde hovedkontoret har bandlyst mig for trusler og fordi jeg har taget billede af det medlem som har angrebet mig fysisk og truet mig.På det grundlag er vi i gang med at køre en sag og vil gerne anmode om, at hovedkontoret kontakter mig da jeres kontaktservice er den rene jungle.",Trustpilot

Det er ca. 1 år siden det skete sidst (og for under et år siden steg mit All-In også). Der står nogle fine floskler om, at det skyldes, at mit medlemsskab har en lavere pris end et tilsvarende i dag. Det er helt korrekt, men jeg kan ikke rigtig se problemet? Man kunne lige så godt skrive: 'Vi har desværre ingen intentioner om at belønne loyale kunder med høj ancennitet, da vi ønsker at maksimere vores profit"". Hvis man følte, at man fik noget for de ekstra penge, var det måske en anden snak, men jeg har ikke oplevet nogen forbedringer siden I blev til PureGym (ny maling med kikset farvesammensætning samt cringe 'motivationscitater' gør ingen forskel for min daglige træning).Personligt er jeg nok ved at nå mit mætningspunkt for hvad jeg gider betale for at træne i et (ofte) propfyldt center.24-10-2023: Jeres svar nedenfor kan jeg desværre ikke rigtigt bruge til noget. Det er jo bare et standardsvar, der ikke rigtigt adresserer problematikken. Jeg kan stadig  ikke se problemet i at kunder med høj ancennitet betaler mindre end nye? Selv hvis man udelukkende kørte sit regnskab/medlemsdatabase i Excel, burde dette være til at håndtere.Det er fint, at man i jeres app kan se hvornår der er mindst belastning, og det er sikkert nyttigt for mange.

Mens det område hvor man sveder mindst (styrketræning) er der behageligt køligt. Så lige omvendt af hvad man har mest har brug for.... Så om sommeren er der ret ulideligt hvis man laver kardio, men afstanden til andet relevant center gør at man må leve med det:-( Der er ikke en dato som sådan for oplevelsen.

Men ja faciliteterne er så fine - kan man bruge demEDIT: Det er måske ikke juridisk scam nej, men I har ikke ligefrem brug for pengene, og påtvinger folk at skulle betale for en måned, hvor man ikke har mulighed for at bruge det. Havde man brækket ryggen havde I vel haft samme regel. Hvorfor har man lavet en sådan betingelse? Andet end at tvinge folk til at smide penge ud i den blå luft?Nu kan man ikke lige vide når man skriver under på en kontrakt, at man pludselig skal flytte meget langt væk fra den ene dag til den anden. Og ja wow så kan jeg skifte center i den sidste del af min periode - MEN så skal jeg også lige betale flere penge for det, da centrene ikke koster det samme :)Det er rent pengescam - i nasser på almindelige mennesker, der kæmper med økonomien - I kan godt se der ingen grund er til den ekstra måned - hvad skal I forberede før man stopper? .....

PureGym,Oscar,1,"Jeg må desværre konstatere, at PureGym har nogle betydelige ulemper, som gør det svært at anbefale. For det første er det problematisk, at man skal betale hele 70 kr, hvis man glemmer sit kort. Det virker som en form for skjult gebyr eller hemmeligt abonnement, hvilket desværre er en praksis, der er alt for udbredt blandt PureGym.Desuden føles det som om, man bliver bundet til at være en ekstra pengemaskine. Priserne er simpelthen alt for høje i forhold til alternativer som Fitness X, hvor man kan træne for blot 150 kr. Det er ærgerligt, at man skal betale en formue for at have adgang til ordentlig træning.Men ulemperne stopper ikke her. I mit lokale fitnesscenter er der desværre alt for varmt. Det gør det utroligt ubehageligt at træne, og det er svært at holde ud i længere tid. Derudover bliver der spillet musik alt for højt, så det føles nærmest som om, de prøver at omdanne stedet til et diskotek i stedet for et seriøst træningscenter.Alt i alt er jeg desværre ikke tilfreds med min oplevelse hos PureGym, og jeg ser mig nødsaget til at melde mig ud.",Trustpilot

De sagde at det ikke var deres skyld, men mit ansvar, siden det stod på kvitteringen, og de nægtede derfor at hjælpe. Efter en samtale frem og tilbage hvor jeg spurgte dem om vi kunne finde på en løsning, fik jeg uhøflige beskeder tilbage, men til sidst ændrede de opsigelsen.Det her var en super frustrerende oplevelse hvor jeg både følte mig snydt og nedgjort af personalet.

Her gjorde hun dog et godt forsøg.Så blev det desværre weekend og jeg kunne derfor ikke kontakte kundeservice før efter weekenden. I mellem tiden er kampagnen åbenbart slut.

Man ser jeres reklame spots på tv i centeret med reklame for at træne på diverse maskiner som så for manges vedkommende slet ikke findes i centeret. De andre centre i byen har efterhånden fået nye maskinparker og snakken går om folk der smutter til andre centre hvilket ses tydeligt på visse tidspunkter hvor der før var mange ude at træne om morgenen/formiddag til at man næsten har centeret for sig selv idag.,Trustpilot

Maskiner osv.Nu er der derimod kommet en ny leder, og han minder mest af alt en tidligere medarbejder der nu har fået en vigtigere rolle og nyder den magt han besidder. Servicen er væk, vores ønsker kan slet slet ikke komme på tale og bliver udelukket lynhurtigt uden at der bliver lyttet til det. Sedlen hvor der står hvilke tider mandlige medarbejder kommer og gør rent er hevet ned og nu hænger der en ny seddel hvor der står de pludselig kan troppe ind. Vi får straks at vide hvad vi IKKE MÅ, uden at det overhovedet var samtale emnet. Man gør normalt alt for at blive bedre, det er desværre ikke tilfældet her og jeg håber inderligt at vi fortsat kan have et center med mulighed for at træne i et rum, kun for kvinder, under ledere der ønsker vores tilstedeværelse både som folk der træner og som kunder..

Jeg holder også af Bettys Latin og Yogahold i Ikast selvom jeg sjældent kan nå hendes hold. De ligger også samme dag som min elskede Zumba. Jeg kan ikke fordrage det lille bitte lokale til holdtræning i Ikast. Og gulvet er enten super fedtet så ens knæ er låst fast i gulvet, eller glat af kondens der driver ned af vinduer og spejle, når der rigtigt bliver hedt i rummet. Trods det, at vi kører med to blæsere for fuld skrue. Jeg er klar over den udendørs temperatur kan svinge, men jeg oplever ikke de problemer på Viborgvej i Herning. Kun lige pt. hvor deres luftanlæg slet ikke virker. Men ellers aldrig.Bare vi dog kunne få noget bedre klima i Ikast - eller et større lokale.

PureGym,Erik,2,"Jeg plejer træne ved Håndværkerbyen i Greve, hvor de har et fint træningscenter med godt vedligeholdt udstyr og rene og pæne lokaler.Indeklima er dog helt utrolig dårligt! Pga. frygt for tyveri eller at folk lurer sig ind for at træne om aftenen (antager jeg), lukker de samtlige vinduer og døre klokken 18-19 når det sidste personale går hjem, hvor de har demonteret dørhåndtag og håndtag på vinduer. Da ventilationsanlægget er af ældre årgang, og sjældent virker, bliver lokalerne fyldt op med co2, hvilket gør det nærmest umuligt at bruge kondimaskinerne, fordi man ikke kan få vejret. I dag var det så alvorlig, at jeg var tvunget til at afbryde min træning, fordi jeg ikke kunne få vejret, og var nædt til at gå ud af bygningen for at komme mig igen. Hvis man ikke invisterer i enten flere vifter, åbner vinduer/døre også om aftenen, eller reparerer ventilationen, ret hurtigt, så ser jeg ikke anden mulighed end at opsige mit abonnement, og finde et andet sted at træne.",Trustpilot

Posen indeholder vand, proteinshake og arm strap. Da jeg vender mig om står en mørkhåret kvindelig medarbejder i nakken af mig. Hun har tilsyneladende jagtet mig fra jeg kom ind (hun stod ikke i indgangen).Hun fortæller mig, at jeg IKKE må medbringe denne pose i centret og den skal ned i et skab i omklædningsrummet.Jeg forklarer, at jeg har trænet mange år i Fitness World på samme lokation, hvor det aldrig har været et problem. Hun svarer, at de tidligere må have overset det, da det står i jeres betingelser.Jeg har selvfølgelig forståelse for hvis det var en stor taske som var i vejen med tøj eller lignende, men vi snakker en lille Føtex pose som fylder mindre end hvis jeg skulle placere indholdet hver for sig på gulvet.Jeg har i øvrigt sendt denne klage til Pure Fitness.

Gode faciliteter, godt udstyr og personalet er super venligt, dog er der ting der undre mig lidt.Som sagt har jeg trænet her i over et år og har det første år altid haft en gymbag/taske med ind til min træning. Har en del forskellige ting med i tasken som jeg gennem min træning skal bruge, fx headphones, træningsbælte, straps, wristwraps, opvarmningstrøje, Squat sko og drikkedunk. Før indtil fornyeligt har de aldrig sagt noget til det, (andre centre jeg har trænet i har heler ikke haft noget imod det). indtil for 1-2 måneder siden hvor jeg 2 gange som den eneste af flere personer med en taske fik at vide jeg ikke måtte have den inde i centeret, de forslog i stedet en mullepose hvilket jeg ikke helt forstår. For det første gør det træningen merkant mere besværlig da man har svært ved at have samling på sine ting, for det andet forstår jeg ikke hvad forskel det gør om jeg har en træningstaske eller en mullepose med, hvad er grundlaget for dette? For det tredje føles det lidt som om der bliver forskelsbehandlet på medlemmerne. fx var jeg i dag i fitten hvor jeg havde min taske med, jeg fik som den eneste at vide jeg skulle gå ud og ligge den i omklædningen, der var både en pige og en ældre hære der også havde tasker med, men de fik intet at vide. Nu har jeg læst op i reglerne og ja der står ""ingen tasker i centeret"" men hvorfor ? hvad er problemet med en træningstaske i et træningscenter? Vil bare gerne have uddybet hvorfor min træning lige pludselig skal irriteres af sådan en regel. Hvad er grunden? Og nej ""det er på grund af brandfare"" køber jeg altså ikke, en mullepose er vel ligeså brandfarlig. Nu ved jeg selvfølgelig godt det ikke er dig der svare på beskeden eller personalet der laver reglerne, derfor undskyld for tonen. Fortsat god dag - Hilsen et lidt utilfreds medlem.",Trustpilot

Det er fuldstændig uhørt at man skal tage tøj på efter en Spinningtime hvor man har svedt så det hagler af én, blandt andet pga. der er meget dårlig udluftning/ventilation i Spinningslokalet. Jeg havde meldt mig til en Spinning time, søndag den 27.08.23, for at erfare at der ikke var mulighed for at skylle sig bagefter. Som følge heraf, måtte jeg tage hjem igen. Jeg vil gerne have en besked om hvornår badefaciliteterne åbnes igen, da jeg ikke kan deltage på hold uden at blive vasket af efterfølgende. Det er direkte ulækkert. Hvorfor har man ikke givet medlemmerne besked, så ikke jeg kom forgæves? I er hurtige til at tage gebyr når man ikke dukker op til et hold man har meldt sig til og som man af den ene eller anden grund ikke fik afmeldt 2 timer før.

Efterfølgende er abonnementsprisen blevet hævet af flere omgange så jeg har betalt 199 kr. om måneden for et cure abonnement der pt. står til 149 kr. Jeg gjorde kundeservice opmærksom på jeg altså betalte 50 kr. mere, end hvad abonnementet stod til, og jeg derfor forventede at få det jeg havde betalt for meget refunderet. Her bliver jeg gjort opmærksom på at det ikke er muligt at refundere det tilbageliggende, men at der i fremtiden sagtens kunne faktureres efter den oplyste pris... dvs.  havde jeg ikke opdaget prisændringen havde jeg forsat med at betale 600 kr. for meget for mit abonnement om året. hmm fair nok, jeg kunne have været mere vågen på prisændringerne. Men at hæve prisen, for i det ''skjulte'' at sænke prisen senere, er definitionen af bondefangeri og ikke noget en kunde bør bruge tid på at bekymre sig over.

PureGym,Julie,2,"Jeg troede at overgangen fra Fitness World ville bringe mere godt med sig. Men lidt klatmaling hist og pist var hvad det kunne blive til. Og et nyt tema med virkelig kiksede farver. Jeg træner på Lygten i København NV, og det er altså slidt. Flere af skiverne i lokalet ovenpå mangler deres coating, fordi den er slidt af. Der mangler håndvægte rundt omkring. Grebene til fx kabeltårnene er slidt og beskidte. Der er nærmest ingen spejle nogle steder mere, og de er for mange nyttige under træning, for at se fx ens holdning under en øvelse. Toiletterne er en historie for sig, og selvom jeg har klaget flere gange, er de fortsat mega beskidte, løse håndtag, konstant klamt og vådt gulv, væggene er møgbeskidte. Jeg tror aldrig fugerne i gulvet er blevet ordnet. Jeg har selv været ansat i Fitness World og stod for rengøringen, så jeg er udemærket klar over opgavens omfang. Men det her er bare klamt.Og generelt savner jeg bare, at man som medlem af Fitness World før i tiden kunne bevæge sig frit i alle centrene. Så hvis man var i Jylland kunne man træne der, selvom man boede i Næstved normalt. Nu er der forskellige prisniveauer og det er svært at gennemskue forskellen, da alle centrene for mig virker ens. Jeg synes de forskellige medlemskaber er for forvirrende.",Trustpilot

I juli måned var vi, ligesom mange andre, ude at rejse. En betaling for juli måned kunne ikke gennemføres, og vi forsøgte at betale med et nyt kort uden held midt i ferien. Der er ingen telefonnummer på PureGyms hjemmeside, og heller ikke en chatfunktion, der fungerer. Vi endte med at få to rykkere på hver 100 kr. I august trak de penge fra kontoen, selvom adgangen til PureGym var spærret...? Det er simpelthen så besværligt at opsige aftalen.

PureGym,Laila,1,"Vil aldrig nogensinde anbefale PureGym til nogle. Jeg møder op fysisk i centeret d. 30/5-23, hvor jeg skulle blive tilmeldt. Jeg får at vide, at jeg vil modtage et link per mail med en formular jeg skal udfylde indenfor 24 timer for at jeg er medlem. Jeg modtager aldrig den mail og jeg vælger efterhånden at droppe at blive medlem hos PureGym. Pludselig, d. 17/8-23 modtager jeg post på e-boks om at jeg er røget i inkasso, pga. manglende betalinger - som de ifølge dem selv har gjort mig opmærksom om flere gange. Åbenbart var jeg blevet medlem, selvom medarbejderen sagde jeg først skulle udfylde formularen. Jeg kontakter kundeservice og siger der er sket en misforståelse, da jeg ikke har modtaget noget som helst. Men jeg bliver gang på gang henvist til inkasso-selskabet uden at der bliver vist nogen som helst forståelse for min situation. Jeg kontakter inkasso-selskabet og finder ud af, at medarbejderen tastede min mail forkert ind på trods af at jeg stavede det for hende. Inkassoselskabet fjerner inkasso-gebyret og jeg betaler, og derefter kontakter jeg PureGym igen (deres chatservice) hvor jeg vil annullere mit medlemskab samt ændre min mail. Jeg får at vide at mit medlemskab udløber den 31/8 og hun fået ændret min mail. Jeg logger derefter ind på min side efter at jeg har nulstillet koden, og sjovt... jeg er inde på min mands konto, som tilfældigvis også har afmeldt sit medlemskab og har sidste dag den 31/8. Lige nu sidder jeg med deres chat-kundeservice igen og har bedt dem om at dobbelttjekke om, mit medlemskab stadig er i gang - medarbejderen har været i gang med at undersøge det de sidste 15 minutter....... ??. Jeg har nu betalt de ca. 800kr ind til dem, som jeg ""skylder"" for at få det overståetJeg er frustreret og ked over den manglende forståelse for min situation.

Nu kræver det ny indmeldelse (og nyt gebyr) til trods for at det ikke er vores fejl.Medlemsservice lukkede chatten efter at vi havde ytret vores kritik og nu skal vi selv have bøvlet med at tage ned i centeret og melde ind på ny, hvilket er svært for det just medarbejdere man finder i centret - trods det at man ankommer i det tidsrum hvor der står at de er der??

Alle andre steder i kbh med parkering i tilknytning til puregym kan man parkere i hele tidsrummet. Min bil er nu låst inde til imorgen tidligt, hvorfor jeg skal betale for en hel nat.

Forresten jeg studerer på DTU kemi ;) så jeg har taget en lille prøve af kemi fra flasken (der som hænger ved skraldespande) så vil jeg gerne undersøge på lab om det er så ufarligt den kemi i bruger:) DET ER IKKE PARFUMEFRI!!!!Holstebro. De bruger rengøringskemi som fremkalder allergi, astma, samt hovedpine. Hele omklædningsrum lugter af kemi. Hvis I går op i miljø og medarbejders, samt kunders helbred så anbefaler jeg at bruge vand og lidt rengøringsmiddel med svanemærke. Jeg har været i fitness i 30 min og meldt mig fra med det samme.

Svaret jeg fik var ""Så folk ikke melder sig fra for at udnytte vores tilbud"". Da jeg forklarede at jeg ikke ville melde mig ind igen, og om jeg måske kunne undgå at betale, får de mig til at føle mig dum, og jeg får fortalt at jeg skulle have læst det med småt. Oven i dette, havde jeg ikke brugt deres faciliteter i omkring 3 måneder (min fejl at jeg ikke meldte mig ud tidligere), hvor jeg spørger om jeg kan få nogle af pengene refunderet.

PureGym,Mads Mikkelsen,1,Jeg har været tilfreds med mit abonnement indtil videre men for nyligt blev jeg virkelig forbavset. Jeg lagde for nyligt mærke til min abonnementspris var højere end den der blev vist på skilte og hjemmeside. Jeg har et basis abb med all in og det stod umiddelbart korrekt på hjemmesiden men der blev trukket noget mere hver måned end dét. Jeg snakkede derefter med personalet i PG Trøjborg og hun fortalte at jeg har kørt til en for høj pris i noget tid da de for nyligt havde sat prisen ned på basis abb (jeg har dog for nogle måneder siden modtaget en email om at min pris steg med 20kr om mdr men det kunne personalet ikke svare på hvorfor det modsagde hinanden??) Ikke nok med at man ikke automatisk bliver informeret om at priserne falder og man kører til forkert pris så kan jeg heller ikke få refunderet pengene siger hun? Så tænker jeg nå nu skal prisen bare passe og så får jeg fortalt at jeg skal betale et gebyr for at få sat prisen ned på mit abonnement. Undskyld men hvad f***? Jeg betaler for all in og synes allerede jeg betaler rigeligt men så skal jeg betale for at i ikke har informeret mig ordentligt samt for at køre til den korrekte pris... Det fik jeg heller ikke nogen forklaring på bare en “det er ikke mig der laver reglerne”. Yderligere får jeg at vide at jeg er tilmeldt betalingsservice hvilket også har et lille md gebyr??

De fortæller at der ikke er så meget at gøre udover at jeg kan betale 399 kr + 139 kr for den ene måned jeg mangler. Det skal nævnes at det næsten er det dobbelte af hvad jeg betaler i dag.

Efter samtalen med jeres personale, henvender et sødt medlem sig til mig, for at tjekke om jeg er okey, da han havde overhørt lidt af samtalen og at han var meget forarget, og han aldrig havde oplevet noget lignende.

PureGym,Jacob Thomsen,2,"Først på året fik vi igen prisstigninger smidt i nakken. Begrundelse herved var fornyelse og renovering. Egentlig et forståligt argument.Men jeg må blot her 6-7 måneder efter erkende, at mit stamcenter er faldefærdigt og i dårlig stand. Bevares, nyt skilt på facaden og en klat maling på en enkelt væg i deres nu nye farver - det var det. Omklædningsrum står stadigvæk under renovering eller som et rod her 3 måneder efter påbegyndelse. Det er under al kritik. Grunden til jeg nu skriver denne anmeldelse er at 2 ud af 5 crossmaskiner jeg benytter, nu er i stykker og har været det i 3 uger. Det virker som om der ikke serviceres på maskinerne overhovedet. De få der nu er tilbage der virker, knirker og larmer og er generelt bare af tvivlsom kvalitet. Det er simpelthen for ringe et center.Jeg har endnu ikke talt med lederen af centeret, da jeg primært træner uden for centerets bemandingstid.  Hvem har ansvaret for det rod? Hvor er forbedringen for den ekstra merpris vi nu betaler?Center: PureGym, Skt. Hans Gade, 5000 Odense C.Svar til PureGym:Hvor ligger renoveringen af badefaciliteter? Ja, det kan bruges det er ganske korrekt. Men der ligger plader og flyder og der stinker voldsomt af urin. Derfor er vinduerne i rummet altid åbne. Du skriver som om en prisstigning af 20 kr ikke er af betydning. Her er jeg ikke enig. Priserne på el er gået tilbage, sænker i så prisen på medlemskabet? Så vidt jeg husker skrev i at årsagen var forbedringer og renovering af jeres centre som være de årsagen. Det er bare ikke sket i det her center.",Trustpilot

Man skal skrive en mail eller på deres hjemmeside og kan forvente svar efter 3-4 dage, og måske længere ventetid omkring den 1 i måneden.Jeg mener at med de priser, så burde der at være telefontid, bare nogle timer om dagen.Jeg er faldet og har brækket min arm to steder og skal ifølge lægen holde den i ro.

PureGym,Posten,1,"Ingen hjælp at hente fra PureGym da jeg glemte at taste min bils reg nr ind på standeren en enkelt gang. Det kostede mig 875 kr at holde på en halvøde p-plads i en 30 min. ""Ikke vores problem"" var svaret da jeg bad om hjælp. Så jeg opsagde medlemsskab 6. juni, blot for at finde ud af at PureGym bliver ved med at opkræve medlemsgebyr t.o.m juli! Ingen anden begrundelse end ""fordi vi kan"".Der mangler vist lidt lovgivning på området mht retten til at opkræve medlemsgebyr længe efter man har meldt sig ud. Det foregår elektronisk i dag så undskyldningen med at det er noget administrativt holder ikke.Det er ikke rimeligt at firmaer som PureGym kan alliere sig med p-selskaber, som så ligger på lur og kan udskrive gebyrer på 875 kr for 30 min på en øde plads. PureGym kunne sagtens lave en aftale med p-selskab så den gratis parkering man får automatisk bliver aktiveret når man scanner sit adgangskort. Men det har man vurderet ikke er umagen værd.2023-07-12:Hej Igen PureGym.Jeg ved fra lignende tilfælde at i som forretningsdrivende kan udøve indflydelse på P-selskabet og i kan bevise at jeg var der i 30 min. og at jeg havde lov at holde der i 2 timer.

Jeg har som enkeltperson ingen chancer, da jeg jo selvforskyldt, havde glemt at registrere mig.I kunne også sagtens koble medlemmers bilers reg. nummer op på medlemskabet så man automatisk har to timer at holde i når man skanner medlemskortet ved indgangen. Men det har i også valgt ikke at bruge ressourcer på...Når man skal registrere bilen separat på en iPad efter man er kommet ind, og ikke får en påmindelse om det, vil der altid være nogen der glemmer det en enkelt gang.

Der er ingen vinduer som kan åbnes, hvilket skaber ubehageligt indendørs klima, da det eneste der enlig nedkøler hele centeret er de blæser som bliver sat op, og selv de hjælper begrænset, for ikke at nævne den mængde strøm som bliver kastet ud af vinduet, fordi centeret er så ringe opsat. Dårligt indrettet, udstyr der ikke bliver tørt af efter brug, udstyr som ikke bliver sat på plads.

PureGym,Zascha,1,"Jeg træner i pure gym på Vanløse torv, hvor air condition oftest ikke virker - det bliver således ulideligt at træne og man må gå hjem før tid. Man betaler dog stadig urolig mange penge om måneden for IKKE at kunne gennemføre sin træning. Jeg kommer minimum fire gange om ugen og det er kun ca én gang om måneden, at air con virker. Jeg har kontaktet manager i det pågældende center, samt flere medarbejdere - de siger allesammen, at de er fuldstændig enige med mig i, at det er ulideligt at være der, men de kæmper selv med hovedkontoret, som NÆGTER at gøre noget ved problemet. Jeg har også kontaktet hovedkontoret og forklaret om problemet og i øvrigt bedt om kompensation for de mange timers træning jeg går glip af, idet jeg må forlade centeret før tid for at kunne trække vejret igen. Jeg blev affejet med et plat svar om, at sådan skulle air con være - altså give absolut ingen luft - og mit spørgsmål om kompensation blev fuldstændig ignoreret. Det skal lige siges, at medarbejderne i centeret (som heller ikke kan trække vejret) åbner døre og vinduer når de er der og så er det jo klart, at Air con ikke virker. Jeg er derfor begyndt at komme uden for bemandet åbningstid, men der virker det så heller ikke. Mit sidste forsøg på at skabe forbedring bliver denne anmeldelse og hvis I stadig ikke er villige til, at gøre noget ved problemet, så ligger Loop heldigvis lige ved siden af. Til sidst vil jeg nævne den eneste positive ting, som jeg kan komme i tanke om, og det er at der næsten ikke er flere medlemmer tilbage i netop dette center, så man står aldrig nogensinde i kø til en maskine ;-) måske I på hovedkontoret skulle begynde, at overveje HVORFOR vi er så få tilbage i centret og hvorfor Loop får flere og flere medlemmer - man kan sgu ikke ligefrem kalde jer konkurrencedygtige.",Trustpilot

Jeg skrev til dem, da jeg havde sat mit hold på pause, som jeg havde fået hjælp til over telefonen, da det stadig var FitnessWorld. Da kunne jeg i hvert fald godt finde et telefonnummer. Min pause var blevet slettet på fakturaen. Trods at der stod på min app, at jeg var på pause. Da jeg skrev blev jeg beskyldt for at lyve, og nu vil de ikke svare mig på mails. Udover det synes jeg det er suspekt, at de ikke længere gør det muligt for at få hjælp over telefonen.Man skal også lige være opmærksom på, at de sender smser når et hold man er meldt til er aflyst, men de sender ikke smser, hvis man er på venteliste, og kommer på et hold pga afmelding, så det kan hurtigt komme til at koste et gebyr, hvis ikke man er opmærksom på dette.

I forbindelse med flytning var jeg nødsaget til at afmelde mit medlemskab personligt i centeret, her blev det ikke registreret korrekt, og jeg har oplevet en række besværligheder som følge heraf.PureGym tilbyder at refundere et lille beløb som en form for erstatning, samtidig med at de hævder, at jeg ikke har opsagt mit medlemskab. Dette virker både modsætningsfyldt og uretfærdigt. Hvis de virkelig mener, at jeg ikke har opsagt mit medlemskab, hvorfor er de så villige til at give en form for kompensation? Det virker som en indrømmelse af deres fejl, men de nægter at kompensere mig retfærdigt.Som en loyal kunde havde jeg forventet en professionel og retfærdig behandling fra dette fitnesscenter. Desværre er mine forventninger ikke blevet opfyldt. Jeg kan ikke anbefale denne virksomhed til nogen, og jeg giver dem kun én stjerne for deres utilstrækkelige service og manglende retfærdighed.Jeg håber, at min anmeldelse vil hjælpe andre potentielle kunder med at træffe en informeret beslutning og opfordre fitnesscentret til at forbedre deres kundeservice og rette op på uretfærdighederne.Finder vi en løsning, vil anmeldelsen selvfølgelig blive revuderet.Redigering* Har været i dialog med dem, og ingen løsning er fundet - Kommentar på Trustpilot om at man skal finde en løsning er ubrugelig",Trustpilot

I skriver at et plus medlemskab er fra 229kr!? I hvilken del af landet skal man betale det? Jeg skal betale 399kr? I princippet skal jeg nu betale mere end 100kr for samme medlemskab. Det er en prisstigning på over 30%.

PureGym,Evy Aagaard,1,"Vedr. Blomstervej i Tilst.Det er bedrøveligt at give PureGym kun 1 stjerne, men det skyldes at udbudet af Hold-træning til Yoga først mindskes og nu helt forsvinder for PureGym på Blomstervej i Tilst. Årsagen er, at der ikke findes en dør der kan lukkes til Hold-lokalet, så det bliver muligt at høre instruktørens instruktioner. Der er meget larm fra træningsaktiviteter, musik, snak/grin der foregår lige uden for det store åbne indgangspartis til Hold-lokalet, som er MEGET forstyrrende.Selv om man henvender sig gentagne gange til Fitness World/PureGym sker der intet. Jeg får det ene henholdende retursvar efter det andet fra PureGym. Resultatet er nu, at Claudia som er en super dygtig instruktør holder op med at undervise i Yoga på Blomstervej i Tilst. Det er fuldt forståeligt, hvis Claudia er blevet SÅ træt af at høre på brok over dårlig lydforhold fra mig og andre. Jeg er ret frustrerende over ikke at kunne høre instruktionen til Yoga øvelserne tydeligt, og at jeg flere gange bliver hylet ud af den ved høje lyde, når jeg er midt i en øvelse eller afspænding.Det må være en fallit erklæring for PureGym, at I ikke kan tilbyde yoga hold på et så stort og flot træningscenter og med ordentlige lydforhold.Sørgeligt, at jeg skal overveje at lede efter et andet træningssted.",Trustpilot

PureGym,Celine D.,2,"Jeg har været medlem af PureGym (tidligere fitness world) i 4 år ca. Jeg har brugt holdene rigtig meget. Kvaliteten af disse hold kan varierer meget. Nogle er super gode hvor man virkelig får smæk for pengene, andre er elendige.Grunden til at jeg skærer en ekstra stjerne fra, er at deres trænere bliver skiftet meget ud (i de tre Næstved centre), og fordi de har den her regl med, at et hold stopper hvis der ikke kommer mindst 10 hver gang. Så kan være svært at holde et morgenholdet ude for kbh. Samtidig har de det med at overfylde nogle holdsale i eftermiddagstimerne, hvilket er ubekvemligt om sommeren, især hvis centeret er et sted hvor de ikke må støje, og derfor ikke kan åbne vinduerne under timer med høj musik.Om jeg kan anbefale PureGym kommer an på hvilke center det er. Roskildes er mega godt. God plads, gode trænere. Fedt centerDen ved Frederiksberg svømmehallen havde et godt yogahold i weekend før corona, og deres svømmehal er ok. Fedt at man kan svømme før eller efter sin træning. Hvis de stadig har det. Dem i Næstved er ret meh og som sagt bliver trænerne udskiftet meget.

Det giver slet ingen mening, da jeg selv har meldt mig ind i et andet center, og min datter aldrig fik brugt sit medlemsskab.Jeg havde ingen mulighed for at opdage, at det kun var sat på pause, da Pure Gym ikke har sendt en bekræftelse til mig som betaler.

PureGym,Mikkel Larsen,1,"Er fornyeligt flyttet til Nyborg og jeg må sige jeres afdeling i Nyborg er det mest ringe fitness center jeg har været i. Stort set alle maskiner er før krigen, og vi snakke slaget på reden i 1764. Det er ikke unormalt der er et par maskiner der ikke virker, men som ikke er skiltet med e ikke virker, i går var jeg på tre forskellige maskiner der ikke virkede. Værst er nok at der ikke er et eneste vindue i centeret der kan lukkes op, hvilket vil sige at i det tidsrum der ikke er personale, så er alt (døre) lukket. Dét kombineret med et halv sløjt ventilation system, der kun tænder hver 15-20 min. og kører måske 5 minutter gør at der er så dårlig luft og ulideligt varmt. Jeg har været i center uden vinduer, men så er der store fan/propeller i loftet over det hele, så man i det mindste ikke skal stå i 25 graders varm stillestående sved luft.Hvorfor er dét man vælger at bruge penge på at få det malet, i stedet for at få lavet et par vinduer der kan åbnes?Herreomklædningensrummet er så lille så hvis man er tre personer derinde, så er der ikke mere bænkplads, no kidding. Det er fuldstændig uproportioneret lille ifht. centeres størrelse, samt jeg ser der nærmest ikke er nogen der tager bad fordi man står fuldstændig blottet for al trafik rundt i rummet, dét er fuldstændigt absurd man ikke lige sætter et par skydeluger for indgangen til bad afdelingen, men det er vel bevidst fordi i ved der ikke er så mange der har lyst til at tag bad når man står helt blottet og endda foran et gigantisk spejl???, men så spare i penge på varmt vand! En lille sidste ting er at når man kommer til centeret bliver man i indgangen mødt af en lille metalplade med ekstremt skarpe hjørner og kanter. Den er helt bukket opi flere hjørner og kommer man i sandaler, klipklappere eller lign. er der stor fare for man skær sine fødder ret alvorligt, det er absolut ikke i orden. Kanten som jernpladen ligger over er kun til evt fragtmænds palleløfter (kanten er så lille at en kørestolsbruger sagtens kan kører over uden problem), men det kunne altså løses pålagt mere forsvarlige måder end det er nu. Men det præsenter meget godt centeret som det er, ringe, træt og ude af form.Jeg ved der er rigtig mange der er flygtet ned til et nybyggede center med nye maskiner og som endda er billigere, kun ca. 200 meter derfra, det burde jeg også, men jeg har en autocamper og kører meget ifht. arbejde og derfor er det meget rart kunne benytte de forskellige center, men det her er dog under lavmålet. Kom nu lidt ind i kampen, og selv om det er provinsen. Centeret er virkelig godt besøgt (sålænge det vare) så jeg begriber ikke det skal være så et fitness museum i så dårlig stand.Edit: svar : Jeg er okay med på at når det er varmt udenfor så er det også varmt indenfor, så dum er jeg tros alt heller ikke! Men tak for info. Jeg kan så oplyse dig om det er rart med lidt gemmentræk af frisk luft, når det er varmt udenfor. Dette center ligger på en p-plads ved en slags mini udendørs center, der er ingen boliger i nærheden og den eneste larm er den musik i selv spiller, så det kunne man jo bare slukke, så er man også fri for at skulle overdøve jeres musik med ens eget musik. Så undskyldning om det ikke kan lade sig gøre er noget vrøvl. Desuden kører dette centers ventilation absolut ikke hele tiden. Man kan mærke det hvis man er på en maskine ud foran en luftdysse i længere tid at den kun kører 5 min og holder pause i 15-20min før man kan mærke den igen. Der lugter tit som en gammel skole madpakke når man træder ind i centeret, hvis de to døre der er ikke er åbne. Dette er jo også et tydeligt bevis for ventilationen ikke virker korrekt, eller så har i bare indstillet den at kører minimalt for at spare på strømmen. I kunne for min skyld bare slukke ventilation hvis der var nogle vinduer.Selv tak.",Trustpilot

Så overtog britiske Puregym og siden har intet fungeret: Vores kort har ikke virket, så vi har utallige gange ikke kunne komme ind sammen (træningsmakker dvs. dyreste abonnement), og kundeservice er arrogante og belærende. Da vi henvender os i receptionen for nu 117. gang med problemet og irritabelt siger, at nu har vi fået nok, og nu vil vi have I fikser problemet, så sender virksomheden os en advarsel for ""dårlig opførsel"" og påstår vi ikke har talt ""pænt"" til den ansatte dvs. vi bliver anklager for noget, som overhovedet ikke passer, og som en ansvarlig manager ville kunne få afkræftet ved at se på overvågningsvideoen: Vi er utilfredse (ja med rette!), men der er ingen af os som har opført os dårligt eller talt grimt til den ansatte.

PureGym,Kenneth PT Lund,2,"Det her er for så vidt en helt generel betragtning, dog vil jeg komme med eksempler direkte fra mit lokale center. Og nej, du får ikke at vide hvor det er, det er ligegyldigt. Og personalet gør deres bedste under de vilkår som er udstukket fra en af de mest rigide organisationer jeg nogensinde har stiftet bekendtskab med.Og for lige at tage den i opløbet: jaja jeg kan bare træne et andet sted. Det kunne jeg sikkert godt.Der er flere grunde til at jeg ikke lige nu føler trang til det. Men det skal lige huskes, at med Fitness Worlds aggressive tilgang på pris og markedsføring fjernede de effektivt de fleste små fitnesscentre. De lavede endda en kæde ""Urban Gym"" for lige effektivt at støvsuge markedet. Hov... Urban er vist da lukket nu? Jeg kan ikke huske hvor mange penge der skulle bruges til at gå fra ""FitnessWorld"" til ""Puregym"", men det var vist et 3-cifret millionbeløb.Naivt troede man som medlem (eller jeg gjorde) at der lige kom en eller anden form for renovering, nye maskiner eller...?Det synes ikke at være tilfældet. I det mindste ikke hvor jeg træner. Det er bare navnet der ændres. Jeg kalder det for gammel vin på nye flasker. Staffage. Eller bedre: nu gør vi det her, så glemmer de sikkert alt det der IKKE er godt.  !Jeg vil vædde på, at et navneskift ikke kommer til at ændre noget som helst relevant i forhold til de ting, oftest småting, der efter min mening skulle have været i fokus. Det er så små og simple ting, at mit bud er at var det en anden virksomhed blev det ordnet/fixet/løst med det samme!Det er klart at mine betragtninger er meget subjektive, altså i forhold til hvad JEG mangler osv i mit lokale træningscenter, men her er lidt fra godteposen:1. Hvorfor er det at det skal tage en evighed at få repareret eller udskiftet en legextension? jo jo, der er da en mere ovenpå... But why? Det ville tage mig eller en anden 20 min at fixe det. Eller måske endda en ansat? Men det må de vist ikke.HVORFOR BLIVER MASKINER OG UDSTYR IKKE FIXET INDEN FOR RIMELIG TID? - og det er sgu max 48 timer!2. Hov - der faldt et ur ned. I stykker. Et nyt koster max 129,00 i Føtex. Hvorfor skal der gå 4-5 uger før et nyt kommer op - hvis det kommer? FORDI ALT ER TOPSTYRET - DER SKAL TILLADELSE TIL. OG SÅ SKAL VI DA LIGE SE OM IKKE DER LIGGER ET PÅ FJERNLAGERET - MÅSKE FRA URBAN?3. Den der ting til landmine ville altså sidde meget bedre hvis den blev rykket 1,5 meter. Skal jeg gøre det?Det er 2 bolte der skal skrues på. Nej nej. a. vi skal da lige høre om det er ok overhovedet at flytte den og b. hvis det er ok skal det være vores egen teknikker. Nej fra HQ. Det havde nok også taget 6 uger at få den flyttet4. I  Kettlebells. Indrømmet - der sæt i competition fra 8-32 kg. Så er der en 36 og en 40. Forespørgsel: kan man måske købe en 36 og 40 mere? Du ved, så der sæt hele vejen til 40 kg? Igen: vi skal lige se om der er nogen på lager. Fair nok, det ville vi andre også have gjort. Der hvor det så bliver liiiidt stramt er, når der IKKE er nogen på lager og det er en negativ til at KØBE. Jeg mener, FitnessWorld har med sikkerhed mulighed for at købe langt billigere end os dødelige, men i dagens DK vil det kunne købes af almindelige mennesker for hmmm.... 2500?Det DET jeg mener med at det sgu er ligegyldigt med et navn for at være smart, eller signalere udvikling eller hvad det nu går ud på...De mange penge kunne være gået til at få malet lidt her og der i mit center, få skiftet spejle der er smadret, få udskiftet lidt meget slidte maskiner, må et par nye (ja - gerne fra fjernlager). I det hele taget vise interesse for MEDLEMMERNE der efter min bedste overbevisning IKKE er eller bliver imponeret over en meningsløs og ligegyldig navneændring - og da slet ikke hvis det ikke følges op på anden måde. Mine penge skal sgu da ikke gå til at ændre et navn?????Brug pengene på at ansætte mere personale. Personale der ved hvad service er. (Uffe Holm har et rigtig godt tilbud til dem der gerne vil vide hvad service er) Ja ja, rengøring er vigtig, men det er vigtigere at have TID og BLIK for medlemmerne.Ansæt noget personale der kan andet end at gøre rent og udlevere et medlemskort, som kan spotte et medlem der er ved at splitte sig selv eller en maskine ad. Kan hjælpe dem. Give dem en god oplevelse.Brug penge på at ændre hele konceptet? Jeg ved godt at der gøres - halvhjertede - forsøg på at skabe fælleskab med vilje... det kommer bare ikke længere end til videoreklamerne. Hold? Ikke i mit center. Jeg VED at der på det sted tidligere har været pænt mange hold - jeg har selv haft en del af dem... Men de fleste fitnesscentre har et ambivalent forhold til hold. De KAN være gode for bundlinjen, men oftest er de det ikke. Og så er det no go for PureG. Desværre for DET er noget der helt af sig selv giver fællesskab.Har meget mere, men kun 109 tegn tilbage  Nok ingen reaktion fra Puregym  desværre.God dag til alle. Læs, lær, løft og lev.",Trustpilot
PureGym,Henrik,1,"Jeg træner ugentlig i tidligere Fitness World nu Pure GYM på Viborgvej i Hasle Aarhus V. Vi er fire drenge som fast træner sammen og har fejlmeldt cyklerne 24 og 26 siden efterårsferien 2022 da vi cykeltræner sammen. Vi har talt med måde personalet ved Fitness World og Pure GYM som siger det ikke er til at få en tekniker. Hvad med at udskifte cyklerne til nogle nye. Vi har for en uge siden og igen idag talt med en flink medarbejder, som beklager at der ikke er sket noget siden vi fejlmeldte cyklerne. Vi er totalt overraskede over, at vi kan nævne det så mange gange og der intet sker. Cyklerne 24 og 26 har skabt så meget frustration at to venner er startet op i andet center.

PureGym,Jone,1,"Kære Fitnessworld ,Jeg må endnu engang udtrykke min skuffelse over jeres manglende reaktion på vores gentagne henvendelser. Det er tydeligt, at I ikke prioriterer at opdatere jeres udstyr, hvilket resulterer i en utrolig kedelig og gammeldags træningsoplevelse i Farum. Vi bliver ikke rigtig motiverede eller får fornøjelsen af at træne på jeres facilitet.Jeg har gentagne gange henvendt mig til jeres kundeservice og gjort det klart, at vi har brug for udskiftning af flere maskiner. Desværre får vi blot standardiserede svar, hvor I takker for vores beskeder og lover, at der snart vil blive handlet. Desværre ser vi ingen handling fra jeres side.Jeg er oprigtigt ligeglad med, om I ændrer navnet på stedet eller ej. Det er langt mindre vigtigt end at få opdateret det forældede udstyr, som forhindrer os i at nyde vores træning og opnå vores mål. Det er på tide, at I begynder at tage vores klager seriøst og handler for at forbedre forholdene i stedet for at negligere vores bekymringer.Vi forventer, at I lytter til os, som betalende kunder, og prioriterer opdatering af udstyret. Vi fortjener en bedre træningsoplevelse, og det er på tide, at I gør noget ved det.Med venlig hilsen,",Trustpilot

PureGym,Hodja,1,"Hold jer langt væk fra Puregym. I Oktober sidste år er jeg enten ved en teknisk fejl i deres system eller af en ansat, blevet tilmeldt Puregyms All-In medlemskab, hvilket kostede mig 119kr(senere 139) ekstra om måneden indtil jeg opdagede det for nyligt. 1087kr for meget er blevet trukket fra min konto. Jeg har forsøgt at bruge deres formular system som de ikke svarer på. Nu kom jeg endelig igennem til en chat samtale, hvor jeg virkelig skulle kæmpe, bare for at høre at de kun var villige til at refundere en del af beløbet. Da jeg sagde at jeg ikke ville slippe sagen før jeg var blevet tilbagebetalt, kom han med en beregning der ikke matchede det jeg har betalt for meget, der var tydelige fejl som eksempelvis at jeg skulle betale dobbelt medlemsskabspris for Juni måned. Han gad ikke diskutere det yderligere.Puregyms svar under denne anmeldese er ikke korrekt, jeg får ikke hele det skyldige beløb refunderet, de har været villige til at give mig et symbolsk beløb tilbage, men ikke hele beløbet. Det tenderer til ulovlig praksis og er meget ansvarsløst.",Trustpilot
PureGym,Erik Humblebug,1,"I den senere tid har jeg flere gange hørt den træningsvejeldning, som den personlige træner i centret på Thors Bakke i Randers giver.Han fortæller direkte nye medlemmer, at de skal lade være med at bruge cardiomaskiner i centret, for den perfekte træning er lidt udstrækning og 3 - 4 timers styrketræning. Og efter hvad jeg kan se, er det let styrketræning, som vi taler om.I samme center er der en planche, der fortæller, at cardiotræning bl.a. giver kondition. Og styrketræning giver styrke og udholdenhed.Derfor er jeg gået til ledelsen og fortalt, at den personlige træner giver en træningsvejledning, der ikke virker, hvis målet med træning er vægttab og kondition.Svaret fra centerlederen har været, at betingelsen for, at jeg fortsat kan træne i centret er, at jeg holder inde med kritikken.Jeg  startede i centret den 1. september 2022. Desværre har jeg på det seneste oplevet, at der kommer færre og færre i centret. Jeg synes det er logisk, når personalet vejleder medlemmer i at opholde sig i centret så lidt som muligt. Du er ikke mere velkommen, hvis du gerne vil være der til længere træningssessioner.Jeg har for ca. 2 måneder siden, gjort personalet opmærksom på, at jeg skal orienteres skriftligt i forbindelse med, at mit center ændrer navn fra Fitness World til Pure Gym.Nu har Pure Gym bare vedtaget med sig selv, at det behøver de ikke. Derfor er medlemmerne dd. ikke orienteret om deres rettigheder som medlemmer efter navneskiftet.Det er efter min mening både sløset og arrogant. Medlemmerne fylder åbenbart ikke ret meget i Pure Gym. For mig er det en naturlig del af en virksomheds service at orientere medlemmerne, når der er ændringer på vej, også selv om det kun er et navneskifte.",Trustpilot

Saunaen er fantastisk, og omklædningen er altid pæn og ren. Der er mange forskellige slags hold, og holdtrænerne virker enormt kompetente og nærværende. Min eneste kritik går dog på ventelisterne til holdene, ofte er der over 30 mennesker på ventelisten til populære hold flere uger ud i fremtiden, og det gør det besværligt at planlægge sin træning. Især når man er i toppen af ventelisten en gældende dag, og skal holde sig 'klar' til, hvis man får plads. Jeg er klar over, at det ikke er SATS' 'skyld', omend bare skønt, at deres hold er så populære, men det er desværre ret upraktisk og småirriterende for os, der bare rigtig gerne vil dyrke en masse Gravity.Men alt i alt er jeg yderst tilfreds!",Trustpilot

SATS,Christoffer Hilton,4,"Opdatering: Jeg har fået super god hjælp fra deres medarbejder Patricia, som har hjulpet igennem hele processen. Jeg vil klart vælge Sats næste gang jeg melder mig ind.I perioden da jeg var hos Sats, var det ikke altid at sauna eller den kolde bruser virkede. Kablerne knækkede også ofte, og det tog lang tid inden at det blev fikset. Det har været en periode med sparetider, og en hård økonomi, så det er hvad det er. Dog er det stadig ikke optimalt.Hvad der virkelig ærger mig er, at jeg ikke længere kunne træne, så jeg ville opsige mit abonnoment. Sats tilbyde mig 2 måneders hviletilstand gratis. Det tager jeg imod.Jeg finder ud af, at jeg så ikke længere kan træne, så jeg siger abonnomentet op. Det betyder også, at hviletilstanden opsiges, og at jeg skal betale fra dags dato af +1 måned. Løbende plus en måned er meget normalt, men at de ikke oplyser tydeligt nok, at den hviletilstand de havde tilbudt mig vil blive opsagt skuffer mig meget.Jeg er 20 år, og har altid dyrket sport. Efter at jeg har færdiggjort marathon i start November, vil jeg melde mig ind i fitness igen. At Sats ikke er mere transparent, og at deres kundeservice ikke er til mere hjælp, gør at de mister en kunde, som ellers havde givet mange års indtjening.Edit.

SATS,Mikkel Vallesholm,1,"(anmeldelsen er skrevet efter 8 besøg i centeret over periode på to måneder. Derudover har jeg en bofælle, der benytter centeret væsentligt oftere, som har samme oplevelse)Der mangler generel ledelse af centeret, ellers ville det ikke være så galt...- Der mangler konsekvent håndsprit i halvdelen af dispensere. - Alle toiletter er decideret ulækre. Det ligner umiddelbart, at der ikke tjekkes toiletter mere end 2-3 gange om dagen, hvilket er absurd, når man tænker på mængden af mennesker, der bruger centeret dagligt. Personale burde gå en runde hver time i peaktimerne, men flytter sig sjældent fra skranken, selv når der er flere på arbejde. Derudover lugter toiletterne harsk, hvilket tyder på manglende grundrengøring (andet end at tømme skraldespand og pudse spejl)- ingen vandautomater, hvilket betyder, at man er tvunget ind på ulækre toiletter for at fylde sin vandflaske. - Flere skabe i herrenes omklædningsrum virker ikke, hvilket betyder, at det kan være svært at finde et skab, når man skal træne i travle perioder. - Fejl og mangler overalt. Det er absurd, at tage så mange penge i kontigent, når standen på centret er så ringe. Reb til kabelmaksiner er f.eks. ved at falde fra hinanden. Mange kabelstativer virker ikke grundet manglende karabinhager eller andre relative små fejl, som let burde kunne løses. Den ene toiletdør i herrenes omklædning rum har manglet en lås i snart 2 måneder. Det samme gælder lyset i saunaen.

SATS,Rasmus Christian �stergaard,1,Sats Nygårdsvej. Jeg spørger ind imellem om musikken kan blive skruet lidt ned når jeg træner i centeret. Kun om aftenen når der er få gæster tilbage og næsten alle hører lyd i egne headphones. Typisk siger medarbejderen selvfølgelig og skruer lidt ned. Her til aften oplevede jeg at de skruede højere op i stedet for at skrue ned - da jeg spurgte for anden gang. Klokken var 21.15. Og stort set alle hørte deres egen lyd. Men der stod en gruppe af medarbejder hang ud i desken. (sammen med hvad der fremstod som en gruppe af venner)Hele min familie sætter pris på at træne i centeret og vi benytter os fast af jeres personlige trænere. Men idag oplevede jeg en flabet og uengageret service(i særdeleshed fra een af medarbejderne) Det fremstod som om det var vigtigere at personalet havde en fest end at man som gæst følte sig velkommen.Jeg ville ønske mig et håndtryk af medarbejderen som en slags beklagelse af situationen. Og eventuelt kunne i gøre det klart om det er rimeligt at bede om at  musikken bliver dæmpet efter evt kl 21?,Trustpilot

Det gør at gulvet er beskidt, og det er lidt trist når man selv kommer i rene indendørs sko. Der er osse en del skabe i omklædningen, hvor lågerne er hevet af. Det har de været i månedsvis, derfor ville det være rart at få dem sat på igen.Der er enten ikke aircondition i den første del af centeret, hvor der trænes i maskiner, eller osse virker det ikke.Musikken i centeret er ofte Gansta rap, eller hip hop. Tænker mere at man skulle prøve meget noget musik, der henvender sig til et bredere publikum. Den gruppe unge der hører den slags musik, har i forvejen øretelefoner i ørene, så de hører det ikke Ellers er der et godt udvalg af maskiner, og personalet er søde.

De sorte plader tiltrækker solen og der er vel omkring 50-60 grader ved pladerne. Når man sætter sorte plader på ruderne invendig kommer varmen nemlig ind i lokalet. Sætter man den udvendig bliver varmen ude.

Kunne godt tænke mig en hip thrust maskine, så man ikke skal tage af de normale vægtstænger som der i forvejen er få af. Flere cable maskiner ville også være nice, da de typisk er optaget konstant.Liiiidt varmt lokale, men nu er det jo også sommer :)Det er FRB - Falkoner centret.",Trustpilot

SATS,Noah Osman,3,"Helt klart Danmarks bedste fitnesscenter (Herlev), idet service er i top. Dog er saunaen altid klam, fordi gulvet ikke bliver gjordt rent ordenligt. Ofte stinker saunaen og ofte ligger der døde hudseller på gulvet i ca. 1 måned - medmindre medlemmerne selv skyller det væk. Problemet er især stort i hjørnerne.Desuden ophober der sig vand i saunaens gulv, idet man ikke har taget højde for at vandet selv skal rende ud. Så der er to løsninger: 1) løbende rengøring i løbet af dagen 2) eller ombyg saunaen, så den hælder korrekt, dvs. vandet skal selv rende ud af saunaen. Problemet er så stort at næsten alle medlemmer hælder vand med duft i saunaen, for at fjerne den klamme lugt. I kan opnå de sidste 2 stjerner, hvis I retter op på det.",Trustpilot

SATS,Sean Hansen,1,"SATS Taastrup er et misligeholdt center med en dårlig kultur. Der er huller i gulvet flere steder under skumpladerne, især i Performance området, ca. 4 huller pt. Det er bare ikke i orden for det kan resultere i at man kommer til skade! Der er bl.a. også en kabelmaskine hvis nedre kabel har været i stykker i minimum 6 måneder men det er ikke blevet repareret endnu. Vi er flere der har sagt det, men der sker desværre ikke noget. Herreomklædningen er beskidt og ulækker, det lader ikke til at gulvet bliver rengjort særlig ofte og saunaen lugter også tit ulækkert, men det er nok mere medlemmernes adfærd frem for personalets.Medlemmerne følger ikke reglerne ift. saunaen og på trods af at der står et skilt om ikke at hælde vand direkte på stenene bliver der hurtigt hældt 1 liter på hver 5.-10. minut. Derudover sidder de fleste i deres beskidte underbukser de lige har trænet i og meget få sidder på et håndklæde.Der er nogle af medlemmerne der opfører sig respektløst og er meget højlydte. Jeg har f.eks. oplevet et medlem der gik og skreg som en abe. Jeg har flere gange været vidne til sexistiske og hadefulde ytringer, det skaber stor utryghed og giver en rigtig dårlig følelse. Der var bl.a. én af mellemøstlig baggrund der ytrede at perkerkvinderne skulle holde sig inde i kvindeafdelingen og blive for sig selv og at de ikke har ret til maskinerne på samme måde som mændene har. Derudover sagde personen også at Allah ville dømme dem. Meget skræmmende holdninger og adfærd. Det eneste lyspunkt i dette center, som desværre ikke er nok til at trække op på 2 stjerner er at personalet som jeg har interageret med har været venlige og hjælpsomme. De personlige trænere der er deroppe er også kompetente og venlige.",Trustpilot
SATS,Mor til datter på 9,2,"Har været medlem siden SATS hed FITNESS DK, og jeg må sige at standarden de sidste måneder er raslet ned. Gode instruktører siger op på stribe, hvilket ikke er med til at skabe hverken motivation, struktur eller sammenhængskraft. Altid bookede hold tages af planen uden varsel, Særligt Valby oplever jeg, falder helt igennem, der vælger ledelsen helt at fjerne nogle af de mest populære hold, såsom hot yoga. Hvor Valby har excelleret med et meget stabilt program med Hot Yoga tirs,Tors + weekend- siden starten, og altid fyldte hold- må det siges at være en eklatant dårlig beslutning tilsat elendig kundeservice ikke at ulejlige sig med at informere i forvejen om så drastiske ændringer. Som mange andre vil jeg se mig om efter andre muligheder for træning. At hæve prisen og forringe standarden er komplet meningsløst.  Hvad vil SATS( udover naturligvis at tjene penge)? Og forstår SATS sine kunder? Det virker ikke sådan.Det er super trist at SATS ikke har formået at holde på sine mange dygtige hold instruktører- igennem de sidste par år- det føles mere som afvikling end udvikling.Vågn op og følg med tiden..",Trustpilot

Jeg har ovenikøbet bemærket en upassende og uprofessionel opførsel overfor hans ansatte og har flere gange henvendt mig til dem, hvor de er enige i min påstand om, at denne opførsel ikke burde finde sted og især ikke komme fra en chef/leder.

Men alt er småt og der er ingen faciliteter, ENESTE center uden Sauna. Der er ikke engang koldtvansbruser eller vandhane til drikkevand. Meget lille funktionel område, når der er holdtræning står man midt i centret uden plads og man kan ikke høre træner da alt larm i centret høres. Holdsal med manglende spejle og mærkelig TRX opsætning. Til Yoga kan man ikke se træneren da spejle ikke går ned med til gulvet og hvis man er ude i siden er der slet ingen spejle. Hverken i loft bagvæggen osv. Til TRX står alle og kigger væk fra hinanden.Der har ikke været noget som helst events eller tilbud. Det gamle område der er lukket ned står stadig tomt og ikke ryddet af vejen. Hvilke tanker står Sats med. Prisen er standart høj. Langt højere end i FitnessDK tiden er centret er blevet mindst 70% MINDRE og kan kun træne i det center for at holde prisen nede. Der er ikke noget der gør at bliver end tilknytning til centret når man fjerner alle muligheder for ophold og samtale og ingen events har. Der er heller ikke ligefrem en velkomst komite for nye medlemmer da de møder bomme og ingen ringeklokke. Man skal bøvle med det QR kode hver gang ved ankomst meget lang tid om at åbne gates.

SATS,Frida Budtz,2,"Jeg startede mit medlemskab efteråret 2022. Jeg var fysisk nede i centeret ved vesterport og starte det. Jeg skulle kun betale for at bruge maskiner og det skulle være i det center. Jeg har tidligere haft medlemskab på Nørrebro, men er flyttet siden. Jeg får at vide, at det koster 299kr. Om måneden.I mange måneder går det uden problemer, hvor jeg træner i centeret ved vesterport. I en periode virker deres “check ind” maskiner ikke, men de er søde og lukker bare folk igennem. Men derefter er der så sket en fejl i mit medlemskab. Nu virker det ikke længere til centeret ved vesterport, men det på Nørrebro. Og sats siger nu, at jeg skal betale 409kr. For at beholde mit medlemskab i vesterport centeret. Jeg vælger i stedet at opsige mit abonnement, da jeg synes det er alt for dyrt. Jeg er også irriteret, da jeg ikke rigtig synes sats tager fejlen på sig. Men jeg er altså tvunget til at betale måneden ud + en måned. Som de siger kan jeg stadig bruge mit medlemskab i den periode…, men ikke i vesterport centeret… kun på Nørrebro. Hvor er det bare frustrerende, at jeg ender med at betale for DERES fejl! Det eneste der reder mig er nogle kuponer jeg i min tid har optjent, som gør det muligt for mig at få 12 træninger i vesterport centeret.Generelt skuffet over den fesne service og mangel på anerkendelsen af at det er DEM der har lavet en fejl.",Trustpilot

SATS,Daniel Julin,1,"Jeg klager på det strengeste over den behandling, jeg og flere andre trænende medlemmer i SATS Hørsholm har modtaget i dag af ekspedienterne William og Laura. Jeg oplevede meget stor fjendtlighed og uprofessionel behandling. Hvor flere trænende medlemmer (inklusiv mig selv og min kæreste) trods nyvaskede sko bliver smidt på porten. Med den begrundelse at  de indendørssko man har på, ikke lever op til de meget kritiske ekspedienters vurderinger. Ifølge dem måtte skoen aldrig have været udenfor, hvilket jeg mener er helt urimelige krav. Jeg forstår fuldt ud vigtigheden af, at trænende medlemmer bærer indendørs sko for at opretholde renligheden, Men det, jeg oplevede, var langt over grænsen for rimelighed.Personalet på stedet var meget aggressive og afvisende over for os, da vi forklarede, at vores sko var rene og var blevet vasket. Vi overværede dem endda smide flere andre trænende medlemmer ud og grinede af det bag deres ryg, hvilket jeg finder meget uprofessionelt og respektløst. Jeg vil gerne anmode om, at der tages passende foranstaltninger for at undgå en gentagelse af denne type adfærd fra jeres personales side. Trænende medlemmer skal ikke føle sig truet eller ydmyget af jeres personale, når de træner i jeres faciliteter.Jeg håber, at I vil tage denne klage alvorligt og sørge for, at jeres personale bliver uddannet til at behandle jeres medlemmer med respekt og høflighed.",Trustpilot

Jeg finder først ud af min sag ligger hos en inkasso med ekstra gebyr på 500kr idag da jeg kontakter en kundeservice medarbejder hos Sats. Jeg betaler selfølgelig mit abnomant det har jeg gjordt i over 3 år nu. Men ligepludselig ryger min sag direkte hos en inkasso uden jeg bliver oplyst.Det er ikke en fair måde at behandle en kunde der har været medlem i mere end 3 år. Det er direkte afpresning. Jeg har netop snakket med inkasso beroet som virker forstående over for min sag, da jeg ikke fik regninger grundet min flytning, Inkassoen ville undersøge sagen med Sats, Jeg håber Sats vil tage det seriøst da det er yderst frusterende situation jeg føler jeg sidder i",Trustpilot

I månedsvis har der været tydelig bakteriefilm på væggene, en kraftig stank af kloak og en lugt af coli bakterier (afføring) i saunen. Jeg har gjort dem opmærksom på det flere gange, men der er intet sket. Det er ærgeligt og ret utroligt at Sats er deres kunder det bekendt. Hvor svært kan det egentligt være?Sats uoverskuelige prismodel er heller ikke noget plus. Og som prikken over i'et har vi playlisten i Sats Nørrebro som består af de samme 30 hulkende Joe Moe og Medina sange. I kan ikke længere retfærdiggøre nogle af markedets højeste priser.

Jeg har altid været glad for SATS, tidligere Fitnessdk, og har i alle årene gladelig betalt ekstra for at være medlem fremfor i konkurrerende centre. For man fik jo mere for pengene. Men nu er prisen jo skruet urimeligt højt i vejret samtidig med, at kvalitet, faciliteter, træningsudbud og service er dalende. Desværre oplevelses der ingen velvilje fra SATS' side til forhandling/fastfrysning af pris, trods min høje anciennitet og loyalitet. Det er tydeligt, at jeg er ikke mere værd som kunde end de kunder, der måtte komme ind fra gaden for så hurtigt at melde sig ud igen. Kundeloyalitetsbegrebet overtog SATS ikke fra FitnessDK.

SATS,Kihva AL Darwitz,1,"Mellem jul og nytår tog jeg til træning om aftenen i træningscentret i Valby. Jeg mente at have læst, at SATS nu ville have udvidede åbningstider til kl. 23. Klokken er lidt i 9, da 2 medarbejdere kommer gående mod mig, imens jeg er på vej ud af badet. De stiller sig cirka med 1 meters afstand fra mig og siger, at vi lukker altså nu, hvortil jeg siger: ""Det må I undskylde, men jeg troede I havde fået nye åbningstider"". De står med armene over kors og overbeglor mig, mens jeg står helt nøgen. Jeg føler mig utilpas og forulempet, og synes de virker anmasende og udviser lettere truende adfærd med både kropssprog og ansigtsudtryk. Jeg blir lettere irriteret over deres opførsel, så jeg vender mig om og laver bukken og siger: ""Ved I hvad, det går ikke hurtigere af, at I står og glor på mig."" Så går de 2 høns helt amok og taler i munden på hinanden, at det er sørme da for dårligt, at jeg ikke kan respektere åbningstiderne, og at jeg bør sige undskyld og have det virkelig dårligt med mig selv.For et par uger siden får jeg så besøg af Politiet i omklædningsrummet, som siger, at jeg ikke må være i centret. Jeg forklarer dem situationen, hvortil de siger, skriv til SATS og tage den med dem. Det har jeg gjort for cirka halvanden uge siden.

SATS,Nadia N'diaye,1,"Jeg synes, det er MEGA meget for dårligt, at I har lukket tlf. ude i centrene  Jeg havde været dum at glemme en (dyr) ansigtsrens, som jeg nærmest lige havde fået i julegave, i badet, da jeg havde været ude at træne i onsdags formiddag/eftermiddag. Om morgenen dagen efter fandt jeg ud af, at jeg havde glemt den derude og prøvede straks at finde tlf.nummeret til SATS Roskilde - forgæves! Det eksisterer ikke længere. Så prøvede jeg at ringe til hovedkontoret, da jeg tænkte, de kunne give besked til centret om at finde den og lægge den i en glemmekasse eller noget. Men men, dér er tlf. kun åben ml. 13-15 mandag-fredag  Så måtte jeg sende en mail… Der er op til 8 dages svartid Så prøvede jeg Facebook… Der kan man heller ikke komme direkte i kontakt med sit center! Så jeg skrev i et af jeres opslag og der fik jeg rimelig hurtigt et svar - om at jeg jo var velkommen til at tage ud i centret  Det var jeg ligesom godt selv klar over, man kunne, hvilket jeg selvfølgelig også havde gjort, hvis det havde været muligt! Men nu bor jeg ikke lige ved siden af, så derfor var det først muligt at tage derud mandag formiddag. Og der var selvfølgelig ikke nogen ansigtsrens i glemmekassen  Så nogen har stjålet den, og dét kunne have været undgået, hvis ellers man bare kunne få lov til at ringe til sit center. Det ville have taget en medarbejder 2 min. at gå ud i badet og kigge efter den; jeg tænker, de har tid til det, for der var er meget tomt i centeret om formiddagen. Det er simpelthen under al kritik, og det er MEGA dårlig kundeservice! Udover den kedelige oplevelse, er jeg generelt ked af den nye renovering i centret i Roskilde. Det er blevet SÅ småt, både ude på gulvet og inde i omklædningsrummet/badene. Og det er super nederen, at der ikke længere er hverken pool, sauna eller dampbad Jeg havde egentlig opsagt mit medlemsskab, men overvejede alligevel at blive, men der skal så sandelig meget til at skifte min mening efter den her oplevelse med manglende kundeservice ",Trustpilot

Hvis man ikke kan sørge for at opretholde servicen, burde man nok have beholdt holdet som et lukket hold.

Jeg har talt med mange der er utilfredse og deler det syn, at Sats nu bare er blevet en dyrere version af det samme tilbud som man får hos konkurrenterne. Hvis det blevet så dyrt at drive et ordentligt fitness center, så sæt da priserne lidt op istedet for at fjerne de tilbud der giver jeg en kant ift. til jeres konkurrenter?

SATS,AD,2,"Det dér gjorde Sats til noget særligt ift. til billigere træningstilbud var bl.a. deres områder med sauna og dampbade. I saunaerne (i Sats Fields) taler folk sammen, hælder æteriske olier på ovnen, så det dufter godt, og nogen gange er der saunagus, da flere af medlemmerne er dygtige til at lave det. Der hersker en hyggelig kultur om badeoplevelsen, hvilket runder en træning af på en rar måde. Det samme gjorde sig gældende med dampbadene, hvor man kunne få ro i sindet efter en lang dag på arbejde og efterfølgende træning. Sats har valgt at se stort på deres kunder, eller slet ikke haft øje for ovenstående, og istedet lukket samtlige dampbade, og nu findes der kun saunaer i udvalgte centre. Resultatet er, at de igangværende saunaerne er ulækre, overrendte og at saunaovnene konstant er i stykker i de centre, der fortsat har saunaer. Ovnene er på overarbejde.Jeg tvivler på, Sats har foretaget en user experience analyse, eller en egentlig analyse af deres kundesegment, inden de har lavet de her tiltag. De har med al sandsynlighed kigget med en økonomisk brille på et excel-ark, imens de udviser en ringe forståelse for deres medlemmers ønsker og behov.     Dertil har de sat prisen op for et medlemsskab, men også for eksisterende kunder, så man betaler mere for en ringere træningsoplevelse.

SATS,Hassaan Butt,1,"Serviceniveauet er desværre dalet markant. Priserne stiger, og kvalitet bliver ringere. I har bedre udstyr end hos jeres konkurrent Fitnessworld, men det så også kun DET i kan tilbyde, eftersom Diamond ophøre, dampbadene er lukket permanent, bruserne halvkolde, og sauna kvaliteten er nedadgående. 5 ud af 6 saunaer, som er tilgængelige hos jer er kun tændt op for 33% blus. Den eneste der er på fuld blus er den ved Nygårdsvej.  Det vil være bedre, hvis i lukker saunaerne helt, da en sauna ovn, hvor kun 1/3 del af varmelegemerne tændt, ikke giver en fuldgyldig sauna experience. Så kan det være lige meget med, hvor mange sedler i lægger ud foran døren til saunaen med, at man ikke må hælde vand på stenene. Fejlen består af, at i ikke har alle varmelegemerne tændt i saunaovnen, så temperaturen kommer ikke over de 60-65 grader. Det giver gæsterne en kold oplevelse, hvilket får dem til, at overdosere ovnen med vand for, at øge luftfugtigheden/varmen. På den lange bane får i ødelagt en masse saunaer, da de ikke kan tåle flere liter vand hen over dem. Dette er grunden til, at saunaen ved Fields er stået af, og saunaen ved Nygårdsvej stod af for lidt over 1 uges tid siden. Det resulteret i, at i skulle anskaffe en ny sauna ovn.  Hvis i nu bare sørger for, at have saunaovnen 100% tændt fremfor 33% tændt, så er stenene brændvarme og dermed opnås den optimale varme. Derved falder behovet også for, at hælde vand på stenene. En sauna , skal som hovedregel være mellem 80-90 grader, og det er de langt fra ude i jeres centre, selvom jeres elektroniske termostat påstår det ved receptionsindgangene. Det er blot optisk bedrageri. Jeg ved, hvad jeg taler om, da jeg har arbejdet med saunaovnene for TylöHelo i lidt over tre år. Hvis i skal til, at spare på elregningen, på de få saunaer der er åbne, så kan I ligeså godt lukke dem permanent, fordi ellers bliver de blot bare ødelagt/kortsluttet af medlemmerne, som overdosere dem med vand, men hvem ved. Det kan være, at det er formålet, så I kan give medlemmerne skylden for, at have ødelagt dem. Bottom line - Intet værd, at komme på besøg til en lunken 40-50 graders bakteriefyldt sauna. Ville gerne have givet jer 2 stjerner. 1 stjerne til i har godt fitness udstyr, og (1) stjerne til kundeservice niveauet, men det forbliver kun til 1 enkelt stjerne sammenlagt..

I svarer at dampbad + sauna ikke er en del af jeres ‘kerneprodukter’ og vi ikke betaler for det, men får det som et ‘ekstra gode/gave fra jer’, og at det vi betaler for er træning.. ok, så lad os sige det. MEN hvordan retfærdiggører i så jeres høje pris, hvis sauna og damp (ifølge jeres eget udsagn) ikke tæller med i det vi skal bedømme jer på. For jeres udstyr er ofte gammelt og slidt (som mange andre centre), og ikke specielt bedre end andre centre der er betydeligt billigere. Jeres hygiejne var en gang bedre en fx fw, men nu er det absolut ikke tilfældet. Jeres kundeservice er arrogant og pt ikke-eksisterende. Hvad er det så i mener der kan retfærdiggøre jeres meget højere pris end alle andre? Hvad differentierer jer nu fra andre centre? Jeg kan fortælle at jeg i sin tid valgte jer, først og fremmest pga sauna + damp og dernæst hygiejne.

Herefter er det blevet suppleret med en prisstigning. Den primære grund til at jeg meldte mig ind, var at jeg gerne ville gå i sauna efter træning. Jeg ved også at I selv er fuldt ud klar over, at sauna og wellness er det som adskiller jer (selvom der står med småt at det ikke er en kerneydelse). Selve træningen kan man jo nemt klare i FW. De har også flere centre og bedre åbningstider. Nu er prisen i Sats steget og alle de gode ting er samtidigt blevet fjernet.Jeg har ikke et problem med at betale mere (også mere end det som I har hævet prisen til - den rette pris, for det rette produkt). Det er dog betinget af at der er noget som giver mening at betale for, hvilket I nu har fjernet. Umiddelbart skriver I at det er jeres plan at tænde for saunaerne igen. I månederne op til at I meldte ud officielt at saunaerne blev slukket, var der dog også flere saunaer som hele tiden gik “i stykker”. Det virker lige lovlig belejligt, at det så efterfølgende meldes ud at de slukkes næsten lige efter. Hvis de åbnes igen, vil de så ikke bare være “i stykker” hele tiden? Derudover så foreslog en tekniker på et tidspunkt at der blot blev boret hul i bunden af grillen, så problemet med vand ikke opstod igen. Der blev der så imidlertid takket nej til fra Sats side, hvordan kan det være?Hvad er planen er egentlig? Introducere nye ting? Kommer sauna overhovedet nogensinde tilbage?

SATS,Airk,1,"Har været medlem siden 2019 og nu er jeg udmeldt. For mig begyndte det at gå væsentligt ned ad bakke for SATS, efter at have oplevet flere centre hvor dampbadene ikke virkede. Jeg spurgte de forskellige medarbejdere de pågældende steder om hvorfor de var lukket, og fik forskellige svar alle stederne. Enten var de ude af drift og der var tilkaldt tekniker eller også blev de ved med at gå i stykker m.m. Nogle steder fandt jeg ud af at det var for at spare, men det måtte de ikke officielt sige. Men de lovede at de nok skulle åbne op igen - det havde hovedkontoret lovet. Så kom meldingen (efter 1-2 måneders frustration) at de nu lukkede ned for alle dampbade for at spare (så de ikke skulle lukke centre) og herefter at sauna også blev lukket (de fleste steder). For mig var det hele grunden til at være i SATS og ikke et andet billigere center. Men det alt afgørende har været at de har løjet for deres kunder og kører en super dårlig stil i forhold til information (eller mangel deraf). Udover det er rengøringen ikke eksisterende og der er simpelthen så klamt. Jeg har nu meldt mig ud som konsekvens, da jeg umuligt kan støtte en virksomhed, der er så ligeglade med deres kerne-kunder.",Trustpilot
SATS,Jesper Krabbe,1,"Hej Sats, nu er grænsen nået. Jeg har været hos jer i 7 år. Gradvist er service og rengøring blevet ringere og ringere. Dampbad og sauna, har de sidste par år været eneste ekstra gode hos jer, der har holdt mig fra at skifte. Nu lukkede i dampbad og derefter sauna, næsten alle steder. Der er nu 5 centre med sauna. Jeg har så benyttet den på Nygårdsvej og har hver eneste af de sidste 4 uger fortalt i receptionen at gulvet sejler i bakterier og næsten halvdelen af bænkene er belagt med et tykt lag grøn alge/skimmel/bakteriesuppe og halvrådne bredder. 4 uger og der er ikke sket en fløjtende fis. Det er sundhedsskadeligt og jeres service og rengøring er lige ud sagt elendigt. I giver ikke jeres receptionister nogen form for handlemuligheder, ud over at skrive til en, antageligt blind og døv centerchef, der tydeligt aldrig har stået på gulvet og undersøgt hvad søren det egenligt er som i sælger og byder kunderne. Jeg kommer til at melde jer til sundhedsmyndighederne, da i åbenbart ikke selv kan tage det mindste ansvar i jeres centre og har afmonteret enhver form for logisk tænkning hos jeres ansatte med en hovedløs og fraværende topstyring. Så snart er der nok desværre kun 4 saunaer i brug. Øv. Men hvis jeg kan redde andre for at blive syge i jeres center, så må det være den vej det går.Som det næste kommer jeg til at melde mig ud, hvilket også hænger sammen med, at på trods af alt bliver ringere, så sætter i prisen på mit logbuy medlemskab op med 17%. Hvorfor betale endnu mere for endnu mindre?Har i regnet på hvad i kunne spare ved at slukke hver tredje spotlampe i stedet for saunaen? Der er næppe nogen der dropper medlemskabet fordi der er lidt mere mørkt, men i kommer uden tvivl til at miste mange medlemmer på slukket dampbad og sauna. Jeg kan desværre konkludere at jeres måde at drive forretning på er lige så elendig som jeres rengøring. De tiltag i gør nu vil ramme jeres toplinje hårdere end de costbesparelser i finder frem. Det kan umuligt blive en profitabel strategi. Hvis i har haft eksterne på til at finde på disse tiltag, så bør i få pengene tilbage.Nye ejere, ny ledelse og en regulær turn-around ligner en nødvendighed.Farvel til de 5383 kr. backlog i havde på mig i 2023.

Spurgt om vi ikke kan tænde for varmen i julemåneden, svarer receptionen: ""Det må vi vende med vores chef."" Ikke lige det svar jeg havde forventet.I dagene efter står termostaterne fortsat på nul. Det kan jeg kun tolke til, at det er et helt bevidst valg fra bestyrers side, at der i en tid med høje elpriser ikke bare skal spares på varmeforbruget, men at der intet forbrug skal være.

SATS,Esben Juhl Jespersen,1,"Mens julelysene brænder i ufortrødent fuld flor i de københavnske gader og butikker, skal man lede længe efter en mere arrogant og tonedøv håndtering af ""energikrisen"" end den håndtering man ser hos SATS for tiden. Den seneste måneders forringelse af medlemmernes muligheder ved fratagelse af samtlige wellness tilbud, har blotlagt SATS centrenes åbenlyse fejl og mangler. Hvor deres største konkurrent, Fitness world, renoverer og investerer i deres centre, ser man slidte maskiner der falder fra hinanden konstant, tomme sæbedispensere og badefaciliteter der ikke har set en skurresvamp siden de overtog Fitness DK, hos SATSes centre. Med den ikke anmeldte lukning af nu også deres saunaer, har SATS igen bevist at de sætter profitten højere end kunden, især fordi denne betydelige forringelse af faciliteterne ikke kommer med en nedsættelse af den månedlige ydelse kunderne skal af med. For det ikke skal være nok, så er dem der ønsker at opsige deres abonnement efter lukningen af wellness faciliteterne, nu bundet til at  betale december med. Det er vildt at ledelsen hos SATS igen håber på at kunderne vil lade deres stunt passere, især efter deres manglende handling under corona nedlukningen. Det er tydeligt at SATS ikke har lært ret meget, i deres tid uden for det københavnske marked, og dette sats fra dem, skulle næsten betyde begyndelsen på SATSes andet salg af deres centre i København. ""Rather a closed Steam room than a closed gym"" men kære SATS ledelse, et center kan skam sagtens lukkes ved at man er respektløs over for sine kunder. Jeg kan kun anbefale at man kigger sig om efter et langt billigere fitness abonnement, og bedre kundeservice end den hos SATS, da det der gjorde SATSs centre speciele er ifølge dem selv kun frynsegoder der kan tages fra dig fra den ene dag til den anden.",Trustpilot

SATS,Magnus BS,1,"Blev medlem i Nørrebro-centeret i forbindelse med Black Friday-tilbuddet, da jeg synes det var lækkert, at der var et træningscenter med sauna. Den flinke fyr i receptionen forsikrede mig om, at saunaerne i Nørrebro ikke ville lukke, så jeg bare kunne melde mig ind der. Da jeg blev gjort opmærksom på, at saunaen ville lukke i Nørrebro, fik jeg ingen hjælp til at kunne skifte center - jeg blev kun opfordret til at jeg skulle ringe eller bruge chatfunktionen. Det viser sig, at de begge er ""Midlertidigt Lukket"", så jeg blev nødt til, at skrive i kontaktformularet, der har 10 dages svartid. Så er det heldigt, at måneden når at skifte i løbet af de 10 dage, så SATS har sikret sig en ekstra måneds kontigent.  Med så ringe en kundeoplevelse, hælder det nok mest mod et opsagt medlemsskab herfra. ",Trustpilot

Langt hovedparten af medlemmerne træner nemlig i SATS pga. deres dampbad samt sauna. Jeg håber, at SATS åbner deres dampbad og sauna så hurtigt så muligt, så de udgår at bløde ihjel.

SATS,Thomas,1,"Som så mange andre har skrevet på det seneste, så har SATS besluttet at lukke ned for deres wellness faciliteter. Først var det dampbadet som blev lukket lige da kalendermåneden slog 1. november. Smart løsning, da der er løbende måneds opsigelse - så er man sikker på at kunne holde lidt længere på medlemmerne.Nu står vi i slutningen af november, hvor snakken går på at saunaen bliver lukket per 1. december. Samme fremgangsmåde som ved dampbadene - uden officiel kommunikation fra SATS medlemsservice.Jeg har været medlem af SATS igennem sammenlagt 7 år. Priserne er steget løbende igennem årene, men nu kan de ikke længere forsvares. SATS er blevet en dyr kæde med faciliteter som er værre end deres konkurrenter som gør det til den halve pris.Der er mange medlemmer som er utilfredse med beslutningen selvom, at SATS offentligt på Trustpilot argumenterer, at det kun er ""et fåtal af vores medlemmer"" som benytter disse faciliteter. Når SATS forringer deres services så væsentligt, så er det forventeligt, at man kan komme ud af sin bindingsperiode med øjeblikkelig virkning, da man ikke længere får den service, som man indgik aftalen på.Det er en ærgelig udvikling for SATS, at de ikke længere differentiere sig på et eneste parameter.

Som så mange andre, er jeg medlem af SATS, fordi de blandt andet har dampbad og sauna. Det er også derfor jeg er villig til at betale den merpris der er mellem SATS og deres øvrige konkurrenter.

Det er netop de ekstra faciliteter ift andre kæder som gjort at jeg betalt lidt ekstra og været trofast medlem i 15 år. Noget som vi som medlemmer har haft adgang til som en del af vores medlemskab fjerner I bare?Der er ikke længere en grund til at betale mere for noget man kan få tilsvarende et andet sted.

Skal de også lukkes?Udover det, skriver I, i den FAQ som er uddelt til personalet i centrene at ‘der kan forventes yderligere besparelsesinitiativer i den kommende tid’ Øv, hvor er det trist at I vælger at prioritere som I gør.

Der er beklageligvis en tendens til at medlemmer kommer dryssende, når særligt yoga hold er gået igang - det er til stor gene og ødelægger både undervisningen for os andre og påvirker naturligvis også underviserens flow.Nogle omklædningsrum har en mystisk lugt og toiletterne mangler noget mere tilsyn - selv inde hos kvinderne.

De har været nede/slukket i 2 uger - hvorfor giver I ikke medlemmerne besked om denne vigtig ændring. Der er ingen grund til at betale den høje medlemskab, hvis goder som sauna/dampbad bliver lukket ned. Jeg har erhvervet så mange medlemmer til jer - det er sååå skuffende:-( .

SATS,T. J. Jacobsen,1,"Jeg har nu været medlem i 1826 dage (5 år) siden min seneste anmeldelse, og har netop opsagt mit medlemskab i SATS. Efter sammenlagt 15 år.Det har jeg gjort fordi virksomheden over en længere periode, i øvrigt med tilsyneladende fuldt overlæg, har forringet det jeg betaler for. Muligheder som kontakt til de enkelte centre er helt sløjfet og det skaber stor irritation. Man kan ikke engang ringe til medlemsservice og blive stillet videre - og medlemsservice ved ikke noget om de enkelte centre. De kan udelukkende hjælpe med medlemskab.Jeg er enormt stor fan af wellness-afdelingerne, som jeg mener er nærmest det eneste virkelige parameter SATS har for at holde deres pris så højt oppe ift. konkurrenterne. Hvis ellers bare sauna og dampbade rent faktisk var i drift og blev håndteret korrekt. Men nej. Suk. Det forekommer umanerligt ofte, at wellness er indstillet forkert eller slet ikke virker. Men måske mest irriterende er dog, at centerchefer, personale, interne reparatører og medlemsservice, allesammen ikke ved noget om saunaovne. Deres evindelige forklaring om ""øh ja, sauna er kortsluttet da nogen har hældt vand i"" passer IKKE. Sæt jer nu ordentlig ind i tingene! Det der skaber kortslutninger er normale saunasten, som ikke skiftes regelmæssigt hvert kvartal. De flækker og forvitrer langsomt. Det grus/småsten skader varmelegemer og samler sig i bunden af ovnen, hvor det fører til kortslutning og fejlstrøm på elgruppen ude i sikringsskabet. Løsningen er at lære at skifte saunasten - eller købe keramiske saunasten, som holder 5-7 gange længere end de normale sten. Det forsinker selvfølgelig frekvensen af ens rengøring af saunaovne, men det skal immervæk gøres.Som jeg tidligere har skrevet begriber jeg ikke hvorfor SATS ikke har smidt ""Status for Wellness"" for hvert center i deres ellers udmærkede app, sådan så os kunder lynhurtigt kan se om fx dampbadene i vores favoritcentre virker eller ej.Men man har åbenbart kunder nok. Sikken skam.****************Gammel anmeldelse:God oplevelse men med mange irritationsmomenter: Jeg har været medlem i 3662 dage (10 år). Generelt synes jeg kæden løbende tager kritikken til sig og forbedrer. Ofte opstår der dog rigtigt irriterende oplevelser, som kunne have været undgået.",Trustpilot

Størstedelen af personalet er smilende og imødekommende og de gør en god insats for at holde det pænt og ordentligt.Bad og toilet kan dog godt blive lidt ulækre hen af eftermiddag/aften. Finder regelmæssigt underbukser og tomme proteinflasker i badene. sæbedispenserne er nogle gange tomme og gulvet har en del sokkefnuller. Det er ikke så lækkert at gå i.

SATS,"Helena , København",2,"Siden Sats i Rødovre har fået en ny chef( i 2022) går det helt galt i centret. De bedste instruktører som Tamas(joga), Jakob(spinning) og nu Jens(Zumba) er blevet fyret eller sagt op. Folk i receptionen blev også skiftet, og de nye er ikke ret dygtige til deres stilling, som de forrige var. Hvorfor har Sats fjernet mulighed for at kontakte centret via tlf??Det er virkelig en dårlig service. Hvad med kaffemaskine?? For denne pris, vi betaler, skal Sats levere den højeste kvalitet. I alt. Jeg er i Sats kun pga gruppetræning. Hvis Melani (stram op) også holder, så der er ingenting at lave i centret for mig. Maskiner kan jeg finde i andre centre, som ikke er så dyre som Sats er. Sats har øget kontingent men samtidig har sænket kvaliteten. Det er urimeligt. Den dummeste af centrets chef var at fyre Jens(zumba dans). Jeg siger dette på vegne af alle medlemmer fra min gruppe, som jeg danser med. I har smidt guld på gaden! Jens giver så fantastiske timer med masse af glæde og energi, han er en af de bedste instruktører i Sats Rødovre og har været der ca 10-12 år. HAN MÅTTE IKKE FYRES kun pga af nogle dage i sommer perioden, hvor der var ikke nok folk på holdet(ca 6), men folk holdte måske 2-3 ugersferie  i denne periode.

Jeg har idag forsøgt at afslutte bero perioden da jeg ønskede at genopstarte min træning i jeres center på BLOX. Jeg blev dog mødt af en medarbejder som fortalte at det ikke var muligt. Begrundelsen var at aktivering skulle ske gennem jeres kundeservice og ikke i centeret som tidligere oplyst. Jeres medarbejder tilbød allernådigst at jeg kunne få adgang til centeret uden et genaktiveret medlemskab, dog uden adgang til skab og håndklæde som er inkluderet i mit diamond abonnement.

Jeg taler med én i centeret, der siger, det vil blive modregnet en kommende betaling - der går flere MÅNEDER, og så kontakter jeg dem, men her kræver det at JEG skal dit og dat for at få mine penge tilbage, selvom det er deres fejl.

SATS,E. Atan ,1,"Du skal ikke vælge SATS Taastrup hvis ordenligt udstyr, fleksible åbningstider eller god service betyder noget for dig. Jeg har flere gange trænet med alt for slidte maskiner, der knirker og/eller nærmest gør ondt at anvende. Sammenlignet med andre centre, så ligner udstyret noget fra et museum og der er en utrolig dårlig udluftning i træningscenteret, som gør det svært for medlemmere at trække vejret uden at det skal føles som en sauna (ironisk, da SATS sauna samt dampbad mere end ofte er defekt). Hvis du er personen som kan lide at træne lidt senere på dagen, så skal du være opmærksom på at denne SATS lukker 19:00 på en lørdag samt 20:00 på en fredag og søndag. Imodsætning til Fitness Taastrup samt Fitness World, som lukker 00:00 alle dage og Fitness Hedehusende, som har åbent 24/7. Ydermere skal du ikke forvente den bedste service af nogle medarbejder som tit er fraværende/ligeglade når man har brug for at ekspederes. Du skal også passe på at du ikke bliver “upopulær” i deres øjne, fordi integritet på ingen måder er til stede; et eksempel kunne være, da deres Manager on Duty på ubehagelig vis gik direkte imod mig og med en hård tone fortalte, at jeg skulle forlade centeret med det samme, da jeg havde sandaler på. Jeg bedte om at se hvor reglens fremtrædelse stod (da jeg ikke kan se det i selve centeret, hjemmesiden eller appen) og som svar modtog jeg “det er bare vilkårene”, både fra Manageren og deres kundesupport. Dette skete mens adskillige andre medlemmer trænede med sandaler i fred og ro. Derudover har jeg, sammen med andre, set medarbejder særbehandle enkelte favoriserede medlemmer, der ikke følger reglerne (eksempelvis sandaler som fodtøj) Dette har jeg aldrig oplevet i min tid  hos Fitness world hvor vi kun er blevet modtaget med åbne arme og hjælpsomhed. Det giver ingen mening at man vælger SATS Taastrup, da de ikke yder bedre på nogen punkter. Hvis centeret i sig selv ikke ødelægger din lyst til at træne, så skal manageren nok gøre det.",Trustpilot

SATS,Anne Lykkeskov,1,"Verdens mest absurde administrationDet er svært at vide, hvor man skal begynde med at beskrive omfanget af inkompetence hos SATS - ikke mit lokale center, som jeg faktisk er godt tilfreds med. Det har bare vist sig umuligt for mig at være medlem, fordi administrationen endnu ikke, efter 3 måneder, har kunnet få min betalingsaftale til at virke.Jeg har oprettet aftalen 3 gange, min bank har bekræftet, at aftalen er aktiv, men SATS har stadig ikke fundet ud af at få den til at fungere.De er umulige at komme i kontakt med (sørger for at skjule kontaktdata fuldstændigt på hjemmesiden, ligesom de skjuler abonnementspriserne).Jeg har vist skrevet 10 mails til dem undervejs, hvor jeg prøver at løse problemet. De fleste får jeg ikke svar på - eller de skriver, at de har set, jeg har skrevet, men mailen er tom! eller de kan ikke åbne vedhæftede filer!, ingen af delene har jeg nogensinde haft problemer med ift nogen andre modtagere.De få gange, jeg har fået svar, skriver de at alt er fint, aftalen er oprettet. Blot for så alligevel ikke at hæve kontingentet, og blokere min adgang til centeret.Midt i processen med at få løst problemet, sender de pludselig en opkrævning med posten. Her vil de have mig til at betale et beløb pr 1. juli - og så kan jeg den 12. juli gå ind på hjemmesiden for at se, hvad betalingen dækkede!! formentlig et rykkergebyr, på trods af mine ihærdige forsøg på at få lov til at betale. Tænk at sende en opkrævning, hvor man undlader at skrive, hvad de opkrævede beløb dækker - og have en kundeside på hjemmesiden, hvor man heller ikke kan få oplyst - før 12 dage efter, at betalingen skal falde - hvad man egentlig betaler for!!!Jeg tør slet ikke tænke på, hvor meget tid jeg har brugt på dette, men det er som at slå i en dyne. Jeg får ikke svar på mine mails, og problemet bliver ikke løst. Jeg har mødt inkompetence før, men aldrig i denne skala.Som sagt er jeg glad for mit lokale center og vil virkelig gerne finde en løsning, så jeg kan betale mit abonnement. Men måske må jeg opgive pga den absurde inkompetence i SATSs administration.Så hvis du har andre muligheder end at abonnere hos SATS, så gør det, det kan spare dig for mange ærgelser!",Trustpilot

At en nedgradering ikke kan gøre fysisk var jeg i forvejen noget overrasket over. Kommunikationen på SATS hjemmeside var ualmindelig ringe, og et halvt år efter var min nedgradering stadig ikke sket. Det lykkedes dog endelig til sidst, hvor jeg fik at vide, at jeg kunne få tilbagebetalt det beløb, jeg havde betalt for det fulde medlemsskab i seks måneder i et fysisk SATS center. Da jeg henvendte mig hos SATS Valby for at få udbetalt beløbet, fik jeg desværre samme dårlige service som indledningsvist. Personalet mødte mig med paraderne oppe, indbyrdes rynkede øjenbryn og irriterede miner. Først da jeg ville ringe til Christoffer fra SATS medlemsservice, som havde lovet mig, at jeg ville få udbetalt beløbet, kunne de pludselig se på skærmen, at den var god nok... Det var utrolig ubehageligt at føle sig modarbejdet af SATS personale efter den i forvejen dårlige service på hjemmesiden.

For mig betyder det, at skal jeg være medlem af SATS, så kræver det, at jeg skal betale dobbelt for de måneder jeg er hjemme. Alternativt kan jeg betale 100 kr. pr. gang, hvilket er bliver endnu dyrere, da jeg træner regelmæssigt.

Bad og wellness skal bare virke optimalt når man kommer som medlem og betaler hver måned. Man brænder sig ligefrem under bruseren og må gå ind og ud af badet flere gange. Sidst fik jeg bare at vide at jeg kunne skifte bruser og de ville kigge på det. Idag stod vi et par i kø foran de brusere der virker bedst.

Og her er det ligemeget om det er Fields eller Blox jeg besøger.Det virker absurd at man som medlem, hovedparten af gangene man besøger jeres centre skal stå med denne oplevelse, når der står 3-4 medarbejdere bagved disken og I i forvejen ikke er landets billigste træningstilbud. Normalt holder jeg igen ift. negative anmeldelser. Nu har jeg så forrige uge tilmeldt mig de tre Challenges som er at finde via.

SATS,Alfred ,1,"Skulle op og træne her 1. juledag i centeret på Nygårdsvej - de var så lukket selvom der intet stod i appen om ændrede åbningstider - udelukkende at der var god kapacitet og åbent til kl. 20. Stik modsat til SATS egne kærneværdier jf. 2020 årsrapporten.Simpelthen så ærgerligt hvordan tillid kan forsvinde fuldstændigt på et øjeblik. Selvfølgelig er det dybt jammerligt at dørmagneten til mandeomklædningen i deres center i Parken ikke har virket i de sidste 2-3 uger, at check-in terminalerne har været nede hele december og at man kan have mere håb i at vinde eurojackpotten end at der er sprit i flaskerne (.. og at flaskerne virker) men det her var godt nok en nyt niveau af middelmådighed.Undskylder meget hvis jeg lyder gnaven - det er bare så synderligt skuffende når man virkeligt prøver at have ja-hatten på og tillid i at de næsten 5000 fuldtidsækvivalente der er i SATS nok skal løfte opgaven. Jeg ønsker virkeligt en god oplevelse - jeg arbejder selv med kundeoplevelser og ved hvor svært det kan være at læse intentionerne bag sådan en anmeldelse.Men kære SATS, hvis I virkeligt gerne vil transformere jeres forretning og positionere jer som førende i digitalisering så er I nødsagede til at prioritere basale funktioner som åbningstider i appen så man ikke må køre skuffet hen til centeret og se at den reelle information hænger på et A4. Jeg mødte flere kunder der var kede af det fordi I netop har spildt deres allervigtigste aktiv - det eneste ikke genanvendelige her i livet - nemlig deres tid. Og den (manglende) tillid vinder man kun tilbage ved at ligge sig fladt ned, anerkende de markante svagheder og blive bedre - lidt ligesom når man træner hypertrofi :-).",Trustpilot

SATS,Emilie Jensen,2,"Mandlige medarbejdere kontakter mig privat Jeg har trænet i sats Helsingør i ca. 2 år og inden for det seneste halve år, har jeg oplevet at to af de mandlige medarbejdere har fulgt mig på Instagram, liket mine billeder og den ene har skrevet til mig privat hvis jeg har lagt noget op. Det er selvfølgelig i orden at følge andre på sociale medier, men hvad jeg synes er ubehageligt er at jeg ikke kender dem på forhånd samt at de ikke kender mit navn. Jeg ved at de har adgang til private informationer om mig via deres job bag skranken og frygter at det er den vej igennem de kender mit navn. Derudover har jeg modtaget blikke i træningscenteret fra disse to, hvilket ikke er særlig rart. Dette finder jeg yderst uprofessionelt og gør at jeg ikke længere har lyst til at bruge min tid i sats selvom jeg ellers var glad for træningscenteret",Trustpilot

SATS,TruthtellingBissh,1,"LAD VÆR’ MED AT OPRETTE ET SÅKALDT “1 måneds gratis medlemskab” DET ER SVINDEL! DE TRÆKKER PENGE FRA DIG SELVOM DU IKKE ER KOMMET OG HAR FORTRUDT/OPSAGT MEDLEMSKABET! Jeg har oprettet 1 måneds gratis medlemskab UDEN BINDING hos SATS i slutningen af august. Jeg har derefter aldrig brugt mit medlemskab og desuden haft svært ved at få adgang, i første omløb, til min bruger hos dem. Det skal sige at jeg faktisk ikke engang har sat/udfyldt min bankinformation, eller helt færdiggjort mit indmeldelse. Da jeg ikke var helt sikker. De har bare uden videre brugt min bankkort information fra et tidligere medlemskab hos dem. Sagen er:jeg har oprettet 1 måneds gratis medlemskab + gratis oprettelse i august. Derefter opsagt mit medlemskab (som jeg aldrig fik brugt btw) allerede 19 dage/20 dage efter. Den 19.september. Jeg har fået en kvittering på min opsigelse af medlemskab. Da mit medlemskab desuden var valgt og lovet til at være uden binding, så er det mig en gåde, hvorfor i alverden jeg er blevet trukket et beløb på 402 kr? Desuden har nogen genaktiveret mit medlemskab. Dette har ikke været mig, da jeg ikke engang kan mindes at have været logget ind i min bruger, efter min opsigelse. Jeg har først logget ind igen, efter at være blevet trukket penge fra, og opdaget denne fejl. Jeg vil meget gerne have mine penge, og det kan nærmest kun gå for langsomt. Det er ulovligt at svindle folk. Jeg er mere end forberedt på tage sagen videre. Opsummeret: meldt mig ind for 1 gratis måned + gratis opsigelse uden binding. Opsagt abonnement kort tid efter (indenfor mindre end 1 måned). Blevet trukket mere end medlemskabet overhovedet koster 404,24 kr. Dette er enten en fejl ellers også sker der noget meget mærkeligt her. —- Jeg har informeret dem om alt dette på både facebook og e-mail. Jeg har forsøgt at ringe dem op, men de tager ikke imod opkald pt (nok fordi der er en masse sure kunder, som de har, i min optik, snydt penge ud af) Deres kundeservice er desuden en joke,  og de nægter nærmest at give dig dine penge tilbage. Jeg tror, der er flere mennesker end jeg kan tælle til, som har oplevet det samme(har jeg fundet ud af efterfølgende). De lokker med gratis oprettelse og gratis 1 måneds medlemskab, jeg antager, velvidende at over halvdelen ikke kommer, og de dermed kan tjene gratis penge på jer!!!  Jeg er i processen til at skrive en klage til enten forbrugsstyrelsen eller andet, og finde ud af om dette er lovligt !",Trustpilot

Stadig ikke blevet ordnet.- Jeg har flere gange gjort opmærksom på at man kan se direkte ind i herreomklædningen ude fra træningsområdet. Mere end 5 gange, hver gang med flere ugers mellemrum. Der er ikke blevet gjort noget ved det.- Gulvet i herrebruseområdet bliver meget sjældent gjort rent. Der er altid fuld af sort fnuller. Hvorfor går de ansatte ikke ud og gør rent som jeg har set dem gøre i fx fitness world hvis det var beskidt?- De ansatte har ikke adgang til at bruge lydanlægget til at fortælle når der er 15 min til centret lukker.

Men det er åbenbart fordi jeg ikke har været i dialog med deres kundeservice før, eller forsøgt at opsige medlemskabet før.  Man kan selvfølgelig ikke opsige medlemskabet i centeret, for det ville være for nemt.  I stedet skal man lede siden igennem, indtil man finder et lille link i bunden af en lang smøre om hvad der tilbydes. Derefter trykker man ""nej jeg vil stadig gerne opsige"" så bliver man tilbudt træning hos en personlig træner - Skal derfor trykke ""Nej jeg vil stadig gerne opsige"" og så kommer der en side frem hvor det ligner at det er opsagt, men det er det ikke, du skal lige scrolle ned på siden og vælge dato for udmeldelse. Selvom bindingen er måneden ud plus en måned? Det er kun for lige at snyde et par kunder mere, så de kan få lidt ekstra kroner i kassen sikkert..  Jeg troede det var gået igennem, hvilket damen i centeret bekræftede for mig. Men fordi jeg ikke kan bevise det på skrift, så fralægger de sig alt ansvar og jeg er derfor blevet opkrævet for tre måneder ekstra da jeg ikke havde opdaget det..  Jeg opsagde kun fordi jeg flytter udenlands, og havde tænkt mig at blive kunde igen, men det har jeg aldrig tænkt mig at gøre efter det her.",Trustpilot

Her 4 mdr efter bliver jeg bonnet for over 600kr og får af vide at jeg ikke er meldt ud, som medarbejderen ellers sagde over telefonen. For det første kan man kun skrive til kundeservice, for det andet fralægger de sig alt ansvar og sender rykkere til de får deres penge. Som medlem har du intet at kunne gøre.

Under nedlukningen finder jeg ud af at min træner er gået på barsel; det finder jeg ud via hendes personlig Instagram.. Så lukker Danmark op igen og jeg vil gerne opsige mit medlemskab, da jeg flytter til Århus og de har ingen centre i Jylland.. Jeg skal så stadig betale for løbende og kommende måned; hvilket er helt fint. Men så vil jeg rigtig gerne have noget for mine penge, så vil jeg jo rigtig gerne have mine personlige træninger.

SATS,Aslak Persson,2,"Min søn, på 16 år, har været medlem. Som forældre synes jeg at SATS har været utrolig dårlig til at informere. Det eneste vi har modtaget er en mail om at betale. Ingen login informationer, ingen service. De ansatte i det lokale center er super flinke, men aner intet om noget ift. betaling eller om udmeldelse. Vi fik en login, hvor beskeden et at man ikke kan melde sig ud. En mail om at betale, og at der kommer rykkere, og at udmeldelse skal ske med login. Virkelig dårlig service.Vi har ikke modtaget ""velkomst"" mail. Det er vel rimeligt at vi ikke skal betale så, et passivt medlemskab uden accept virker urimeligt at begrunde som dokumentation for betaling?OPDATERING 21.JULIVi har betalt gammel gæld, på trods af at vi ikke synes det er rimeligt. Og vi har brugt en del tid i telefonen mef SATS. Desværre er der dags dato kommet endnu en betalings rykker og gebyr på en måned mere. Det er meget frustrerende .

Jeg fik nemlig indmeldt et nyt medlem i SATS ved at følge det link de havde sendt mig. Men nu skriver SATS at det nye medlem ikke skulle have været medlem de seneste 3 mdr. Dette forhold fremgik ikke af reklamen. Eller har det også været skrevet med småt. Det er forkert at lokke folk med promotions og så bagefter finde undskyldninger for at ikke honorere sit løfte.

SATS,Elena Inunnguaq Fensbo,3,"Kære Sats,Jeg har virkelig brug for hjælp til at få løst en gotisk knude mellem min centerleder og min holdinstruktør.Det forholder sig således, at der i Taastrup, før nedlukning, var core, dance aerobic og body flow i forlængelse af hinanden mandag og onsdag formiddag.Hvilke jeg har brugt og fået masser af energi, power og glæde.Nu her efter nedlukning, har centerleder, uden at nævne det for instruktør og udøvere, taget body flow af programmet. Dette indebærer så, at vores instruktør må finde andet sted at kunne være instruktør på et body flow hold, derfor har mandagsholdet ikke kunne opretholdes.Så nu er de hold, 6 i alt, mandag og onsdag, reduceret til 2 hold om onsdagen. Instruktøren, som iøvrigt har haft faste og loyale udøvere i SATS i gennem mange år, vil fortsat gerne træne os både mandag og onsdag, startende fra i dag, dog under forudsætning af at der som minimum kommer body flow på programmet. Dette kommer ikke til at ske før til den 22. august i følge centerleder. Den 22. august har vores trofaste og loyale instruktør højt sandsynligt fundet et andet sted at være instruktør.Så fordi, at jeg ved at det har kunne lade sig gøre før, og fordi det er vigtigt for mig, min egen sundhed og glæde, rækker jeg ud til jer, på denne utraditionelle måde, har ikke kunne finde hverken mail eller telefon nr. til hovedkontoret, for indtrængende bede om at i kan hjælpe med at få løst denne knude mellem centerleder og instruktør, så vi kunder af SATS kan glæde os over at få lov til at træne igen. Alternativet for mig er at finde et andet sted at træne, bl.a. fordi at der er + 20 på venteliste på andre hold. hvilket ikke fordre det som SATS må være sat i verden for, nemlig at udbyde træning for jeres medlemmer.Jeg ser frem til at høre fra jer, asap, så jeg igen kan komme i gang med at træne op til i hvertfald 6 gange pr. uge.

SATS,Olena Klymenko,1,"Hvis du vurderer et firma på en skala for aggressiv trækning af penge fra kunder (selvfølgelig uden kundernes deltagelse og vilje) fra 0 til 10, modtager Sats 12. Pas på!  Der er kun et råd - undgå dem.1. SATS overvåger breve fra dem på vores enheder, da de sender en usynlig billede 1x1 pixels i deres breve, så ved de godt hvornår har man åbnet det. Bagefter kan SATS afpresse nogen med det, som det var med mig: “Du har set vores varsel, fordi du har åbnet vores brev”. Giv dem ikke sådan en mulighed for overvågning: Brug Outlook og deaktiver åbning af billeder.  2. Tro ikke dine øjne: hvis din SATS konto siger, at dit abonnement er sat på pause, kan det faktisk være anderledes.  3. Store problemer med fakturaer.  SATS ved slet ikke hvad det er.  Det er nok for dem at sende dig en opkrævning i betalingsservice, og du skal tro på dem, hvad betaler du for denne gang. 4. Inkasso. Ingen er forsikret mod at få en inkassosag, og der er ingen frelse.Jeg har ikke fået intet faktura, intet rykkebrev, intet inkassovarsel og BAMS inkassosagen. “Teknisk fejl” da SATS har profit fra disse “fejl” – det er sjovt. Kære SATS, betal venligst for jeres fejl.Der er ingen mening i at gå til domstolen for at få 1000 kr. tilbage. Dette regner SATS med.  Men SATS regner ikke med, at vi kan forene os, ansætte en god advokat, komme med en klassesag og skabe offentlig resonans. Jeg er i gang med det. Bliv ved. P.S. Undgå at henvende sig til Nævnenes Hus – de er helt hjælpeløse og tager penge for det.",Trustpilot

Derudover gjorde jeg mit for at sige mit medlemskab op i lock-down perioden. De havde blokeret for at opsige via ens profil side.

Husk at SATS bruger RKI for at skræmme jer til at betale. Tjek op på jeres bindingsperiode. Hvis I ikke har en bindingsperiode og mener I har opsagt jeres medlemskab, skal sats stadig bevise I skylder dem penge og siden de har haft så mange tekniske fejl og samtidig ikke har styr på lov og regler, tegner det sig ikke godt for dem. Jeg kan se jeg står præcis i samme situation som mange af jer med RKI. Jeg har ikke været medlem af Sats.com siden august og de vil have jeg skal betale for sep-nov.

Nu starter min betalings periode og med ældre sagen får jeg 25 % rabat.  Jeg har ikke på noget tidspunkt været utilfreds eller i tvivl om at dette er det perfekte sted for mig og alle har taget så godt imod. Alt personalet er fantastiske søde og hjælpsomme og har fuldt ud tjek på tingene.  Yoga undervisningen er kompetent og lærerig, virkelig tilfredsstillende. Der er både hold morgen og aften. Dejligt studie og gode forhold, rent og hyggeligt. Fint bad og skøn sauna. Mange gode fordele og altid god plads. Ønsker for fremtiden ; flere yoga og gerne pilates hold og mere varme i salen.

SATS,Hoang Minh Nguyen,1,"Jeg har boet i Norge i nogle måneder pga. arbejde og meldte mig ind kortvarig i Sats i Stavanger ved Hillevåg. Jeg var skeptisk ift. deres dyrere medlemsskab sammenlignet med andre fitness-kæder, og da jeg flyttede bopæl flere gange under mit ophold i Norge, valgte jeg i god tro på at jeg kunne træne i Jylland efter jeg var færdig med arbejdet. De informerede mig ikke, at Sats i Jylland var opkøbt og at jeg reelt kun kan træne i Sjælland, da den fitnesskæde som har opkøbt Sats i Jylland kun vil konverterer danske medlemskaber. Dette undrer mig at de nordiske lande har så dårlig kommunikation intern og vildledende i deres markedsføring. Jeg valgte bevist ikke at have bindingsperiode og er glad for det så jeg kunne opsige hurtigst muligt! Koncernen er ikke til at få noget fornuftigt ud af via mail, hvor jeg vedhæfter billeder og klager over at jeg vil have min 1 månedsperiode på 539 norske kr. da jeg ikke må/kan træne i Jylland overhovedet(bor i Århus) og ønsker refunderet på baggrund af vildledt markedsføring, hvilket de undveg at svare på og kun referer til min opsigelse er gjort tidsmæssig istedet for at finde en løsning. Kan kun sige at jeg er yderst skuffet over deres dårlige kunderservice og ekstrem dårlig måde samt attitude at behandle deres kunder på! Hold jer langt væk fra denne rådne fitnesskæde, faciliteterne er ikke engang ligeså godt som de reklamerer med og deres kunderservice er ikke værd at bruge krudt på!

SATS,THOMAS ,1,"Jeg har været medlem af FitnessDK siden de for knap 20 år siden åbnede og senere blev overtaget af SATS. Jeg er selvstændig og har derfor kunnet lade min virksomhed betale for mit abonnement. Grundet skader har jeg i flere omgange måtte sætte mit abonnement i bero hvilket blev meddelt til afdelingen på Ros Torv.Via bankafstemning i min virksomhed opdager jeg så at de alligevel har trukket penge hver eneste måned for det fulde abonnement som de ovenikøbet havde hævet ca 30% i pris så det var blevet meget dyrere - uden nogen form for oplysning til mig på noget tidspunkt !!!  En arrogant og iskold kundeservice vil ikke refundere de 7 måneder de trak for fordi jeg ikke skriftligt kunne bevise at jeg havde henvendt mig på Ros Torv i Roskilde. Tiden går og FitnessDK bliver til SATS og i Påsken 2019 har de gratis træning. Dog skulle det registreres på ens navn og ekspedienten på Ros Torv fortæller mig at der stod kr 541 i godskrivning på min konto.Ok tænker jeg. Kan du ikke bare udbetale det ? Nej det kunne hun ikke. Jeg træner 2 gange og kommer desværre ikke rigtig igang og tilbage igen.I november 2019 opdager jeg så at de er begyndt at trække penge for mit abonnement igen fra min virksomhedskonto. Og havde gjort det 5 gange siden påsken.Dvs de bare havde brugt mine gamle oplysninger uden mit samtykke og tilmeldt betalingsservice påny.Jeg bliver rasende og ringer til deres ikke eksisterende kundeservice og beder dem refundere alt det de har trukket.De kunne godt se jeg slet ikke havde været i træningscenteret en eneste gang. Men det ville de ikke.Så i stedet gik jeg i netbanken og slettede betalingsservice aftalen.Dette resulterede så I af jeg i februar 2020 begyndte at få rykkere for mit abonnement som jeg havde opsagt.Jeg protesterede selvfølgelig men denne gang skriftligt. Her blev jeg igen mødt af en utrolig arrogant og fuldstændig ligeglad medarbejder som overhovedet ikke gad sætte sig ind i deres urimelige og grådige behandling. Men han skriver dog han vil udmelde mig pr 31/3-2020Jeg protesterer igen og udtrykker at jeg forlængst har udmeldt mig og de skal betale mig penge retur for de mange måneder de uberettiget har trukket for, hvortil svaret var ""jeg har sagt hvad der skulle siges"".. ingen forståelse what so ever.Nå men tiden går så..... Min store søn på 17 år vil gerne starte op med træning og vælger SATS fordi hans venner også træner der. Men da han er 17år gammel fortæller de at de ikke kan få lov at tilmelde hans konto til betalingsservice uden forældres konto da han er under 18 år.Så vi tog sammen derud igår 20/8-2020.Det hele tastes ind og jeg oplyser denne gang min private bank konto til brug for betalingsservice aftalen. Men pludselig siger ekspedienten at det kunne de ikke alligevel fordi der stod en restance på min konto på ca kr 1350 mener jeg det var.Jeg bliver målløs og også samtidig meget gal over at skulle stå i den situation over for min søn.Selvfølgelig ville jeg ikke betale de penge som jeg ikke skylder, og der var ingen mulighed for flexibilitet selv om min søn intet har med min sag at gøre. Det hele ender med at vi må gå vores vej igen og min søns mor må så tage sig af det i stedet.Jeg er så frustreret over deres dårlige behandling af mig at jeg nu overvejer at politianmelde dem for uberettiget at have trukket penge i årevis fra min virksomhedskonto.Overvejer også forbrugerklagenævnet men da den oprindelige aftale var oprettet som en virksomhedsordning i daværende FitnessDK er der nok ikke de store chancer for at de vil tage sagen, da styrelsen jo kun er for private forbrugere Jeg har et kæmpe netværk og har delt min oplevelse via flere sociale medier og kan bestemt ikke anbefale at træne hos dem grundet deres kundeservice som ikke er eksisterende og deres grådige politik med total mangel på forståelse.",Trustpilot

Gå ind under ""mine sider"" og klik på ""mine indstillinger"" for at finde din faktura.""1) Hvad er lige grunden til at sats ikke på denne trykte faktura kan oplyse om grunden til fakturaen og hvad den opkræver for?2) Når man så bruger tid på at logge på for at finde sin faktura...så findes den ikke. Der er kun en rubrik som hedder kvitteringer. Så når du har betalt din faktura kan du senere se hvad dælen du har betalt for. 3) Det mærkeligste er at jeg på min første træningsdag efter genåbning var ved kassen og betalte det sædvanlige månedlige beløb (som jeg nu har gjort i samfulde 8 år jeg har været medlem i Fitness.dk som nu desværre hedder Sats)En betaling som jeg/man heller ikke kan se i ""mine sider"".Hvorfor skal det være så svært ?",Trustpilot

SATS,Christian ,1,"8 December 2019 er jeg i SATS Frederiksberg da jeg har besluttet at opsige mit medlemskab efter 8 år. Ekspedienten der har vagten den pågældende dag fortæller, at jeg ikke behøver at melde mig ud da jeg jo bare kan ”sætte mit medlemskab på standby og selv aktivere det når jeg igen ønsker at træne i centeret”. Min betaling for den resterende del af December ville blive godtgjort når jeg igen ønskede at være aktiv. Jeg syntes det lød som et udmærket forslag og vi aftalte at det blot blev sat i bero. Til min store overraskelse modtager jeg et girokort ultimo juni 2020 for betaling af medlemskab Juni.  Jeg ringer efterfølgende til centeret og meddeler, at jeg ikke kan acceptere betalingen da jeg jo ikke har aktiveret mit abonnement på ny og heller ikke været til træning siden December 2019. Medarbejderen meddelte at de jævnfør deres nye forretningsbetingelser have aktiveret alle medlemmer pr 1/5 2020. Alle havde modtaget denne information og jeg havde kun mulighed for at sætte abonnement i bero et begrænset antal måneder, hvilket også fremgik af deres nye medlemsbetingelser. Han meddeler desuden at jeg skal foretage udmeldingen via deres hjemme side og at jeg også skal betale for Juni måned. På hjemmesiden skal man for at kunne gennemføre udmelding undervejs først godkende deres nye forretningsbetingelser…….. Ugen efter min telefonsamtale henvender jeg mig igen i Sats Frederiksberg i håbet om at få en afklaring på deres alternative forretningsmetoder, der mest af alt minder om mafia. Jeg taler med Centerlederen der vil se hvad han kan gøre og dernæst kontante mig telefonisk når han har talt med deres hovedkontor. Han meddelere mig ved samme lejlighed at der kan gå op til fire uger da de har mange henvendelser…….Det er næsten fire uger siden jeg var i kontakt med Sats og I dag D 21/7 modtager jeg et rykkerbrev fra Sats med gebyr plus betaling af Juni måned !Brevet er i øvrigt sendt som noreply.

SATS,Anne,1,"Min oplevelse er, at SATS er glade for dine penge, og at de sparer på rengøringen, selv i mit såkaldte premium-center. Det værste for mig var, da jeg var havnet i udlandet, og derfor ikke kunne bruge centeret i en periode. Jeg forsøgte at melde ferie på forskellig vis, men det lod sig ikke gøre. App'en virkede ikke, hjemmesiden virkede ikke, og kundeservice-medarbejderen kunne ikke få det til at virke - men bad mig ""gå ned i centeret og melde ferie"". Jeg oplyste, at jeg jo var rejst til Norge i starten af måneden og ville ikke at komme hjem til Danmark, før et par uger hen i måneden efter - og det var derfor en ekstraordinær situation, og jeg havde brug for deres hjælp til at lave pause i mit abonnement, når jeg nu ikke kunne få det til at fungere online. Jeg bad dem ydmygt om, at hjælpe mig i denne situation, og til sidst var der en kundeservicemedarbejder, der sagde, at han nok skulle skrive det ind i deres system. Det gjorde han så bare ikke. Jeg fik lov at betale for hele perioden, fik flere gange talt med kundeservicemedarbejdere uden pli, der nærmest beskyldte mig for at lyve. Det er ikke en kundeorienteret organisation, men det modsatte. Dog virkede de personlige trænere ofte til at være både dygtige og motiverede.Mht. rengøringen af centeret: er glad for at jeg ikke skal gå der nu, hvor der er corona-tider. Før corona var der det samme snavs på maskinerne dag efter dag. Jeg følte nogen gange, at det var mig der gjorde dem mest rent. Det virkede som om, at de aldrig gjorde rent ind i revner og sprækker, hvor der kunne samle sig snavs og støv, men kun tørrede maskinernes overflader af. Mange medlemmer tørrede ikke maskinerne af efter brug, og der var ingen konsekvens eller høflige henstillinger fra medarbejdernes side.

SATS,Tina,1,"Jeg startede et Personlig Træner forløb med PBS aftale som jeg fra start sagde op så jeg kun skulle have 3 mdr. som er minimum. SATS bekræftede flere gange at det er opsagt (både ved receptionen i Gentoftegade og via medlemsservice), men de bliver ved med at trække pengene (Kr.2400 + andre beløb for PT som jeg ikke forstår ud over medlemsprisen) Det som jeg troede var en enkel aftale på 3 x Kr 2400,- viste sig at blive en meget dyr og uoverskuelig aftale som det endnu ikke er lykkedes mig at komme ud af. Jeg har netop gennemgået alle fakturaer siden aftalens start, og kan se at de har trukket 11.230 for PT aftalen selv om jeg fra start kun ønskede (og ikke har modtaget mere) end 3 mdr. af 2.400,-  Altså kr. 4.030,- mere end det aftalen lød på. Man kan ikke ringe til SATS, og der er op 4 ugers svartid på e-mail. De løber med pengene og lukker telefonerne....Egentlig utroligt at man kan drive forretning med så  lav forretningsetik og ingen kundeservice. Tænker ikke det kan være lovligt bare at hæve kundernes penge som det behager dem.Man kan selvfølgelig altid bede banken tilbageføre beløbet, men irriterende at skulle bruge tid på det fordi SATS ikke har styr på (eller svindler med) deres opkrævninger. Så jeg vil advare alle mod at indgå en sådan aftale, den er umulig at sige op igen, så jeg tænker den eneste løsning er at melde sig helt ud af SATS, og lukke sit kreditkort for at stoppe de ulovlige opkrævninger. Men det kan åbenbart også være svært at melde sig ud kan jeg forstå på andres anmeldelser.....",Trustpilot

SATS,Maia Malou Nørgaard,1,"Jeg er godt nok en skuffet kunde. Har været medlem af fitnessdk og derefter sats, da fitnessdk blev opkøbt af jer, i næsten 5 år +/-. Under corona har jeg åbenbart betalt 129 kr for online træning, hvilket ikke er noget jeg selv har været inde og tilmelde mig - det bliver man åbenbart automatisk, derudover har jeg betalt for de uger I ikke har haft åbent. I fortæller så selv, at jeg ikke skal betale for både juni og juli som en form for kompensation - samtidig opretter I en kampagne, hvor man som ny kunde kan få gratis oprettelse + gratis træning i juni og juli (altså får jeg som kunde ingen rigtig nogen kompensation). Da jeg så i dag vil bruge den eneste sølle kompensation på 200 kr gavekort i jeres centre, har I pakket alt tøj og udstyr sammen, fordi I nu skifter til fitness1. Jeg kan hverken bruge gavekortet til at betale mit medlemskab, eller til jeres online shop - det eneste jeg kan få er proteinbarer og -drikke, som er hverken noget jeg bruger eller har i sinde at bruge. Det er simpelthen for dårligt, og jeg er godt nok ked af, at blive behandlet så dårligt som kunde. Jeg er godt klar over, at i åbenbart har informeret om dette på jeres facebookside og Instagram, men da jeg hverken har Instagram eller rigtigt bruger facebook, er dette bare ikke godt nok. Herudover har I åbenbart også sent mails ud vedrørende online træning, men nu er det altså bare sådan, at man midt i en coronakrise har en masse andet der også skal holdes styr på - uddannelse, anderledes eksamener, arbejde mm. Altså forventede jeg faktisk, at en ordentlig kompensation ville komme, omend man ikke har været inde og nærlæse jeres tusind mails. Jeg kommer grundet ovenstående aldrig til at anbefale sats/fitness1, og jeg påtænker at melde mig ud, da jeg føler mig enormt dårligt behandlet.",Trustpilot

SATS,T Olsen,1,"FitnessDK/Sats har været en lidt blandet oplevelse.Personalet er generelt en positiv oplevelse med venlig og god kundeservice.Instruktørerne er både underholdende - og garant for god træning.Udstyret svinger meget fra center til center - nogle lokationer har helt nyt udstyr, andre steder er væsentlig mere slidt, især spinningudstyret trænger nogle steder til en markant opgradering.Prisen er den samme hele året til trods for at der er færre hold om sommeren.Der opkræves et ekstragebyr v. holdtræning, der overstiger en normal træningstime, hvilket på sin vis er OK, såfremt man som kunde får rabat, når leverandøren reducerer produktet i sommermånederne.Tilbuddet om at “man kan prøve noget nyt” sikrer leverandørens interesser - ikke kundens.Hvis jeg sætter medlemskabet i bero eller melder mig ud om sommeren, kan jeg ikke træne - og skal iøvrigt betale for at blive meldt ind igen.Betingelserne v. indmelding specificerer IKKE hvor mange hold, som Sats er forpligtet til at tilbyde på månedsbasis - til gengæld står der en masse om hvilke forpligtelser, som KUNDEN har.I min optik så skubber man problemet med sæsonudsving over på kunderne og det er ikke OK.Klientellet er desværre ikke altid en lige positiv oplevelse.Der er uforholdsmæssigt meget kvindefnidder med kliker og konstante småkonflikter, som tager alt for meget fokus fra træningen - et af de mere bizarre eksempler er feks. meget voksne mennesker, som stejlt holder på at de skal stå et bestemt sted under holdtræningen.....Jeg har skiftet center og hold flere gange i et forsøg på at få en bedre træning - uden den store succes.Dilemmaet er til at få øje på - hvad gør man i oplevelsesindustrien, når nogle grupper af kunder forpester ens produkt?

SATS,John Hansen-Zederkof,1,"Jvf åbningen af Fitness SATS fitnesscenter, i dag den 11.06.2020, har jeg desværre måttet konstatere, at Deres lille sauna endnu ikke er åbnet og tilgængelig – ligesom resten af centret. Ikke desto mindre tillader SATS sig, til automatisk, at genoptage medlemskabet 100% på/til de gl vilkår & priser. Jeg pointerer mundtligt problemet uden at der i øvrigt kunne kompenseres og ændres på dette forhold. Og da fitness og efterfølgende sauna hænger uadskilleligt sammen i min optik var den eneste løsning derfor den, at stille medlemskabet i bero på max 4 mdr/122 dage til 149 kr. Denne løsningsmulighed udstiller SATS på en virkelig dårlig og ubehagelig måde, idet SATS jo rent kontraktlig burde kompensere mig for dette afsavn i abonnementet.

SATS,Jens H,5,"Jeg mener nok man kan sige at det har været noget af en omvæltning for alle at Danmark lukkede ned i midten af marts, bestemt også for virksomheder, og så især da man stort set ikke vidste hvad der ville ske fra myndigheders side fra den ene dag til den anden. Så vidt jeg ved skete nedlukningen kun én eller to dage før betalingsservices automatiske månedlige forberedelse af betalinger for april måned, og samtidigt skulle virksomhederne utroligt hurtigt finde ud af hvordan de så skulle køre deres virksomheder og finde ud af hvilke services de nu kunne tilbyde som ville være noget deres kunder kunne bruge. Jeg kan levende forestille mig at det må havde været en smertefuld og kaotisk proces hvor det lige tager noget tid at på fuldt styr på det og at ikke alt går som det burde gøre. Jeg må sige at for mig kommunikerede SATS klart nok og omstændighederne taget i betragtning valgte jeg altså at se tiden an og stole på at SATS ville gøre noget fornuftigt for mig som kunde og gøre det som de sagde de ville ifølge deres e-mails. Det er så min oplevelse at det netop er det de har gjort. Jeg valgte også at gå over til et online abonnement til nedsat pris, selvom jeg ikke har brugt det meget, fordi jeg meget nødig vil risikere at undvære SATS i fremtiden. Når jeg logger ind på deres hjemmeside kan jeg se at min abonnementspris ikke er korrekt og det er selvfølgelig ikke sådan det skal være, til gengæld er beløbet på Betalingsservice for maj måned korrekt og inkluderer den lovede kompensation. Desuden synes jeg at det virkelig er lykkedes dem at lave nogle gode online træningstilbud og for mit vedkommende har SATS i det mindste holdt hvad de lovede.",Trustpilot

Vi så ikke mailen i tide og har derfor ikke reageret på den før idag, hvor det er for sent. Medlemskabet er nu digitalt og fastlåst. Quote fra DR.dk i dag: - Man kan ikke bare indgå aftaler på vegne af folk, fordi de ikke siger nej tak. Der er man nødt til at vente på, at forbrugeren vender tilbage. Og jeg undrer mig såre over, at man ikke bare laver det til et tilbud, i stedet for at man i princippet låser forbrugerne. Det er efter min bedste overbevisning ikke lovligt, siger Martha Nør Kjeldsen (Forbrugerrådet)SATS understreger, at hvis et medlem ikke har fået svaret på den udsendte email med valgmuligheder, så hænger man ikke på det digitale medlemsskab.- Vores digitale medlemsskab er meget værdsat hos medlemmerne, derfor besluttede vi at tilbyde det til en lavere pris.

SATS,Jens,1,"SATS har gjort følgene mod deres medlemmer:1. Oprettet et digitalt medlemskab til medlemmer til 129 kr/mnd uden aktivt samtykke fra medlemmer.2.

Opkrævet fuld medlemskab for betaling i april (selvom fitness centret er lukket), dog med kompensering. Problemet med kompensering er at der var et lille vindue til at vælge kompensering, og hvis man ikke tog et aktivt valgt, fik man en kompensering i form af et digitalt medlemskab til 129 kr/mnd. 4. Sendt rykkerbreve for abonnement, hvis man ikke betalte abonnement for april for et lukket center. Selvom de før havde sagt ens medlemskab var sat i bero.5. Skrevet den 12. Marts ""All memberships are automatically put on hold during this period. You do not have to take any action."" selvom der efterfølgene har været behov for aktive valg den 16. og 30. Marts.

SATS,Laura Kinnunen,1,"Jeg har nu siden start marts haft planer om at opsige mit medlemskab hos sats - ikke fordi jeg har været utilfreds med centeret, men da jeg står og skal flytte. Hertil ramte coronakrisen så, og jeg skrev en mail d. 7. april om at jeg ønsker at opsige fra dags dato. På hjemmesiden står der at man ved opsigelse betaler for løbende måned + 1 måned og at det er samme regler her under corona, og dette fik jeg også som svar på min email. Dertil svarede jeg selvfølgelig at jeg ikke vil betale for løbende måned + 1 måned når centrene er lukket, og fik så til svar at mit medlemskab i stedet vil blive forlænget så længe centeret er lukket. Det vil så sige at såfremt SATS åbner op igen d.10. juni skal jeg betale for juni ud samt juli måned i stedet for april og maj, på trods af at jeg på dette tidspunkt slet ikke bor i byen hvor mit center er tilknyttet og altså ikke vil have mulighed for at træne der? Derudover har jeg nu på en mail korrespondance over 4 emails hver gang spurgt ind til hvornår jeg får refunderet de penge jeg har betalt for i den lukkede periode, og hver gang er mit spørgsmål bare blevet ignoreret og i stedet har jeg bare fået et flabet svar om, at mine mails og indvendinger ikke ændrer på noget. SATS låser altså deres kunder til et abonnement de slet ikke ønsker at have og ignorerer blot spørgsmål angående kompensation, samt tvinger mig til at betale for et produkt om 3 måneder som jeg slet ikke kan bruge, på trods af at jeg har opsagt mit medlemskab i april?

Dette er ikke noget som jeg ønsker at støtte op om, men nu kommer næste problem så. Det er ikke muligt at melde sig ud på hjemmesiden, med meldingen ""Dit medlemskab er sat på pause, og det er derfor ikke muligt at ændre dit medlemskab i denne periode"". Man kan først og fremmest undre sig over, at man kan kalde den nuværende tilstand for en pause-tilstand, set i lyset af at man stadig skal betale fuldt beløb for sit medlemsskab. Ligeledes kan det undre én, at det ikke er muligt at melde sig ud online, hvilket i min opfattelse kan opfattes som en smule suspekt. Når det nu ikke er muligt at melde sig ud på hjemmesiden, sender man så virksomheden en mail. Problemet er imidlertid, at virksomheden ""ikke har kapacitet til at svare hurtigt nok"". Derfor må spørgsmålet være: Er man virkelig fanget i et medlemsskab hos SATS, eller er det muligt at komme ud af denne? Ligeledes må en kærkommen anbefaling herfra være, at man kunne gøre det muligt at melde sig ud online, så man på den måde kan hjælpe lidt på den manglende kapacitet på e-mail, hvor mange formentlig gerne vil melde sig ud.

SATS,Henrik Skov,1,"Jeg skrev tidligere om SATS' grådighed, fordi jeg skulle betale 149 kr. for at sætte medlemskabet i bero. Den slags hører ganske enkelt ind under almindelig service at gøre gratis - for en k-u-n-d-e - KUNDE. Derfor kaldte jeg SATS for grådig. Nu har en kendelse fra Forbrugerombudsmanden imidlertid vist, at fitness-kæden rent faktisk ER grådig, fordi SATS i medlemsbetingelserne har gjort det muligt for sig selv at gennemføre ulovlige prisforhøjelser! Den slags gør ordentlige virksomheder ikke. Men det gør SATS.Finans, skriver nemlig i dag 29.2 2020, at Forbrugerombudsmanden har bedt SATS luge ud i deres egne medlemsbetingelser, fordi de har forsøgt at overtræde Aftaleloven.Blandt vilkårene i SATS Danmarks A/S' medlemsbetingelser lå nemlig en 'åben dør' i forhold til næsten ubegrænset at kunne ændre i medlemsbetingelserne - priserne - UDEN først at få accept fra fitnessbrugerne. Når en pris mellem to parter er aftalt, gælder prisen - det burde vist være børnelærdom. Men det mener SATS vist ikke. 'Prisen for en ydelse må efter en aftale nemlig KUN reguleres indenfor det, loven kalder 'rimelige omkostninger', siger Aftaleloven. SATS har med andre ord forsøgt at ændre medlemmernes bankkonti til et potentielt tag-selv-bord.Artiklen er fra i dag og ligger online på Finans.dk",Trustpilot

SATS,Katja KK,1,"Jeg har aldrig oplevet så ringe service.Jeg kan se at SATS så pænt herinde skriver at man skal kontakte dem på diverse mails hvis man er utilfreds, men det duer desværre bare ikke hvis man aldrig får et svar tilbage. Derfor slutter jeg mine frustrationer om denne træningskæde herinde, i håb om at man måske bliver hørt her, da det er det eneste sted jeg mangler...Jeg meldte mig ind i SATS Valby, hvor min kæreste har været medlem i et års tid, og da han startede hos SATS var der fælles spa-/wellness område, hvor der var dampbad, sauna og jacuzzi. Disse faciliteter tiltalte mig meget, og derfor valgte jeg dette center/kæde fremfor en billigere løsning. Dog ville jeg sikre mig dette stadig var nogle faciliteter centeret tilbød, så jeg mødte personligt op hos centeret. Til den ansatte spurgte min kæreste og jeg om der fortsat var de samme faciliteter i centerets ‘wellness'område, som der var i starten af 2019, hvor at hun forsikrede os om at det var der. I det formoder man at der er dampbad, sauna og jacuzzi - hvad end det så er opdelt eller fælles. Min kæreste har haft en lang periode med en skulderskade som har gjort ham ude af stand til at komme i centeret, og da han fortsat betalte for sit meget dyre medlemsskab og prisen i hans abonnement ikke var ændret, formodede vi at der ikke var blevet ændret - SOM lovet af den ansatte. FØRSTE (og eneste gang) jeg satte mine fødder i træningscenteret fandt jeg dog ud af at jeg var blevet misvejledt i forhold til at wellness området 1) ikke har et jacuzzi, og 2) ikke har det fælles - som jeg havde kunne se igennem med, hvis faciliteterne havde været det samme. I følge SATS' betingelser i kontrakten har man 14-dages fuld returret, hvis medlemskabet ikke var blevet brugt. Jeg tænkte at fordi jeg kun havde været nede på deres løbebånd i 30 minutter og misvejledning fra deres side, kunne dette sagtens lade sig gøre. Så jeg gik direkte hjem og skrev til SATS, hvori der stod der kunne gå op til 5 hverdage før man modtog svar. Der gik så bare 10 hverdage før jeg SELV måtte ringe og høre hvad der skete med den sag. Og MAGEN til dårlig kundeservice skal man lede længe efter. Der bliver hverken taget ansvar, og den måde man bliver tiltalt på er simpelthen så pinlig. Tænk at man ikke har mere respekt for sig selv og sit arbejde. Den unge kvinde var ikke løsningsorienteret og var sindsyg respektløs i sin måde at tale på. Hun sagde direkte at 'vi misvejleder ikke' og påstod jeg løj. Den 31/1-2020, får jeg efter de 14 dage ENDELIG personlig svar pr mail fra centerlederen fra SATS Valby, hvor han beder mig uddybe hændelsen, hvilket jeg gør. Det er i dag d. 17/2 og en måned efter jeg var der første gang (og eneste gang), og intet er sket efterfølgende. Ingen løsning, intet svar ydeligere fra SATS Valby. Vil på ingen måde anbefale denne kæde til nogen, og magen til mangel på at tage ansvar og have respekt for sit fag skal man sørme lede længe efter. Og grundet SÅ dårlig service valgte jeg og min kæreste at opsige vores abonnementer, hvorfor man måske heller ikke ydeligere har svaret på mine frustrationer fra SATS Valby.",Trustpilot

SATS,Martin,1,"SATS i Odense på Nyborgvej Jeg har trænet i centret i de sidste 10 år da det både hed exerzice, Fitnessdk osv. Men dem der har gjort det værst indtil videre er SATS.. Jeg har endda været inde på kontoret pga mine tidligere anmeldelser. Jeg har pointeret flere gange med ting som er galt og hver gang siger de at jeg skal have mange tak for at sige tingene og at de vil følge op på det, hvilket der aldrig kommer noget ud af. Jeg vil smide punktere op her så folk kan se hvad de går ind til. 1. Det vrimler med mennesker fra Vollsmose som står og tisser i badet, råber og skriger i træningscentret og kaster med ting efter hinanden (ja nogle gange efter andre mennesker der oppe) 2. Parkeringspladsen er ikke blevet tegnet op, så hver anden gang man skal hjem, så skal man ind og sige i receptionen at man ikke kan få sin bil ud. Og her er tålmodighed en god ting at være i besiddelse af. 3. Der er nærmest ingen mandlige medarbejdere som kan tjekke op på alt det ballade der er i baderummene, så selvom man siger at der står to kratluskere og hælder proteinshake i saunaen så kan de ikke gøre noget fordi deres kvindelig ansatte ikke kan gå der ud. 4. Deres Diamond medlemskab som koster på den anden side af 800 kr. skulle være eksklusivt og give en følelse af at man kommer til et sted hvor man får en god behandling, så er det ret træls at man skal stå og finde værdi genstande som de kan få i depositum for det håndklæde man skal låne som er med i medlemskabet. Og når man skal hjem så skal man nogen gange stå og vente i 5 min nede i receptionen for at få sine værdigenstande med hjem. 5. Selvom personerne i receptionen ser at folk køre op og holder der hvor cyklerne skal være så bliver der ikke sagt noget fordi de ikke tør at sige noget til folk som ikke er danskere. 6. Der er et større antal af indvandre som ikke opføre sig ordenligt der oppe, men der er ikke rigtig nogen som tør sige noget til dem. Hvis det er danskere som en sjældent gang laver noget så er de der med det samme! 7. Tit når jeg er på løbebåndet, crosstraineren eller en af de andre maskiner så plejer jeg at bruge mit trådløse headset til at lave nogle telefonopkald i forbindelse med mit arbejde osv. Jeg taler altid stille og roligt og står ikke stille imens. Alligevel kommer der altid en hen og siger at jeg ikke må snakke i telefon, så skal jeg gå ud i sofaerne (2 meter fra maskinerne) Men der kan sagtens stå 6 personer på løbebåndene og råbe på arabisk til hinanden i 30-40 min. igennem hele lokalet uden at der bliver sagt noget. Det sker HVER dag! 8. Crossfit området bliver reklameret med at være tilgængelig i hele åbningstiden, men når man kommer der ned når der er de såkaldte crossfit-hold så bliver man mødt med sætninger som ""den kan du ikke gå i gang med for den skal vi bruge på et tidspunkt"" så der er nærmest ikke nogen ting man kan bruge (selvom de faktisk står i en rundkreds og snakker om øvelserne de skal lave og slet ikke bruger så meget som 1 maskine endnu) 9. Selvom medarbejderne ser at alle dem fra Vollsmose træner i deres store beskidte udendørssko så siger de ikke det mindste, men de kan sagtens komme hen til alle med hvid hud og stille spørgsmål såsom ""må jeg se hvor dit håndklæde er"" og ""har du inddørssko med"".. det er så diskriminerende. 10. Baderummets udluftning har nærmest aldrig virket tror jeg. På et skilt på døren er der et billede af hvordan man tænder udluftningen (det er et billede af skamlen som står ved døren som man skal sætte i klemme i døren så døren åbner sig 30 cm) og dette er ikke engang en joke. Det er sådan at man tænder udluftningen. Forstil jer 20-30 mennesker i omklædningen som bruger varmt vand, hårtørre og sauna. Man kan ikke holde ud at være der inde i 5 min og man føler næsten at man skal besvime. Jeg kunne skrive meget mere, men stopper her. Skal jeg sige en god ting om det center så er det at deres medarbejder Julie gør et fantastisk stykke arbejde og er venlig og smilende hver gang. Den eneste grund til at jeg træner der er fordi jeg bor 1 min derfra. Kan ikke anbefale dette træningscenter.",Trustpilot

Dvs jeg skal bruge tid hver gang på at lære øvelserne i stedet for at få noget ud af dem.

SATS,Freja Wedenborg,1,"Jeg kan se, at der er flere herinde, der har påpeget SATS' uretmæssige opkrævninger via inkasso-firmaet Intrum, som er i strid med Forbrugerstyrelsens regler. Det har jeg også oplevet.Jeg havde tidligere på året nogle problemer med mit medlemskab hos SATS, fordi SATS ved en fejl var kommet til at stoppe min betalingsserviceaftale.SATS kundeservice fik opklaret problemet, og jeg fik en skriftlig bekræftelse på, at jeg ikke skulle betale rykkergebyrer, men kun de måneders kontingent, jeg manglede, da fejlen lå hos SATS. Det betalte jeg i mit lokale center.Efterfølgende fik jeg alligevel en opkrævning fra Intrum på det beløb, jeg havde betalt, samt et rykkergebyr. Jeg skrev til Intrum, at det måtte være en fejl, eftersom at beløbet er betalt. Jeg har ikke modtaget svar på denne mail. Nu har jeg i stedet fået endnu et brev fra Intrum, hvor der står, at sagen vil blive overgivet til retten og beløbet er hævet med med over 1000 kroner i rykkergebyrer. Jeg har nu haft fat i Intrum, som vil forsøge at opklare sagen via SATS. Men faktum er, at jeg er blevet truet med retsforfølgelse og store rykkergebyrer for en fejl, som ikke er min skyld, og en deraf følgende gæld, som jeg har betalt som aftalt.

Jeg betaler derfor alle regningerne og går ned i jeres center. Her for jeg at vide at mit medlemskab aldrig har været opsagt og at i har sendt en regning til inkasso? en regning jeg aldrig har modtaget? Så nu er jeg i inkasso og har betalt en stor sum penge, på trods af at i har lavet en fejl? Det er simpelthen den dårligste service jeg nogensinde har oplevet. Jeg har skrevet jer en mail angående ovenstående forløb. Jeg håber at i vil imødekomme mine krav, så i igen kan få en glad kunde og en bedre anmeldelse.Opdatering: sats kundeservice har løst alle ovenstående problemer. Jeg har fået en rigtig god behandling og ordentlig forklaring på mit forløb. Jeg har derfor rettet anmeldelsen til 5 stjerner :)",Trustpilot

SATS,Safak Gormez,1,"Til SATS Medlemsservice LederD. 18.11.2019 møder vi op på SATS Ro's Torv for at høre om jeres Trænings muligheder samt for at se jeres center på Ro's Torv.To søde piger byder os velkommen og vi får div. praktiske informationer om jeres Center.Vi får oplyst at der foreligger medlemskabsgebyer på 299kr pr person.Vi bliver oprettet digitalt og der bliver taget billeder af os, ydermere ønskes der digitale underskrifter på en elektronisk plade.Under oprettelsen bliver vi ikke informeret om nogen kontrakt forhold idet der ingen kontrakt bliver præsenteret, hverken for undertegnede eller min kæreste. Vi stiller ikke spørgsmålstegn ved underskrivelse på den digitale plade, da vi naturligvis tror at vores underskrifter omhandler Registreringskort.Dagen efter vælger vi at starte vores træning op, varigheden ender på ca 1 times tid. Her ser vi at SATS Ro's Torv ikke indfrier vores forventninger og min kæreste og jeg vælger at drøfte dette hjemme for at afklare hvad vi vil.Vores afgørelse går på at vi vil annullere vores medlemskab.Jeg ringer d. 20 11.2019 kl 13:54 Til jeres Center på Ro's Torv og meddeler vores status, pigen svare følgende:""Det er vi kede af at høre, jeg skal dog bede jer om at møde personligt op på Centeret mht returnering af pengene, der vi har brug for underskrift"".Det viser jeg naturligvis forståelse for, og jf. Telefonisk aftale møder vi op på Centeret i går ca kl 20:30.Men her får vi en anden besked!Her fortæller endnu en anden pige os om vi ikke er blevet informeret om Kontraktvilkårene og samme svar får hun; Nej det er vi ikke. Vi fortæller igen på ny hvordan hele indmeldelses proccesen har været og at vi IKKE er blevet gjort opmærksomme på at vores digitale underskrift faktisk er til brug for en såkaldt kontrakt.Pigen meddeler at hun er ked af over situationen og at vi burde have blevet informeret om kontrakt vilkårene således at vi så ville vide at en annullering ville udløse indeværende måned plus en måned. Vi gør naturligvis opmærksom på vores utilfredshed over manglende information samt processen for manglende information om jeres kontraktvilkår og hvad den digitale underskriftsplade ren faktisk benyttes til.Denne situation ser vi som manglende klar informationen over for kunden jf. Dansk køberet og manglende information om forløb. Vi imødeser at SATS returnere vores oprettelsesgebyr på 2 x 299 kr samt annullere vores medlemskab.Det bliver ikke bedre af at pigen bag telefonen på SATS Medlemsservice blot taler i munden på mig ved mit opkald til jer i dag d. 21.11.2019 kl 08:25 - ganske uhøfligt og manglende evne i først at lytte samt prøve at være imødekommende over for kunden.Endnu engang imødeser vi at SATS naturligvis imødeser vores hændelse og annullere medlemskabet samt returnere 2 x 299kr for oprettelse.Venlig hilsen",Trustpilot

SATS,Andreas Bech,1,"Pas på med at vælge SATSJeg var medlem af SATS indtil starten af 2019, og betalte via betalingsservice. Havde opsagt mit abonnement, men af en eller anden årsag gik betalingen for den sidste måned ikke igennem via PBS.Mere end 6 måneder efter, får jeg så et brev fra deres inkassopartner Intrum med et gebyr på 100 kroner. Helt uden varsel. Medlemsservice i SATS oplyser, at de ved en fejl ikke har fået sendt en rykker (uden gebyr), og at de derfor har overgivet sagen til  Intrum.Og Intrum har (ifølge SATS) derfor sendt rykker uden gebyr, som sjovt nok heller aldrig er dukket op. Så nu - ud af det blå - får jeg en rykker fra Intrum med et gebyr. Jeg har tilbudt SATS at betale mit udestående med det samme (uden gebyret), men det kan ikke komme på tale - ej heller selvom de ved fejl ikke fik sendt en påmindelse, som de ellers plejer. Det er - ret belejligt - ude af deres hænder. De vil ikke engang refundere gebyret på 100 kr., hvis jeg betaler det til Intrum. Ikke just imødekommende kundeservice. Så tænk over det, hvis I overvejer SATS. Går der kuk i betalingen, risikerer I - helt uden varsel - at blive kontaktet af deres inkassopartner.*******************Update pga. af svar fra SATS:I skriver, at jeg ""ikke har reageret på Intrums fremsendte betalingsvarsel i tide hvorfor de har pålagt et rykkergebyr af 100 kr. for sen betaling.""Jeg har allerede fortalt jer, at jeg ikke har modtaget sådan et varsel fra Intrum - men her er I fuldstændig tonedøve.Jeg har nu talt med Stine fra Intrum igen, og hun bekræfter, at Intrum IKKE har sendt noget varsel. De har kun sendt det inkassovarsel med rykkeren. Det er lidt skræmmende at Intrum først forklarer at kunne se, at SATS har sendt 2-3 rykkere (hvilket SATS adspurgt hertil fortæller IKKE er tilfældet) - og SATS derefter forklarer at Intrum derfor, forud for inkassovarsel med rykker, har sendt et varsel uden rykker (hvilket Intrum adspurgt hertil fortæller HELLER IKKE er tilfældet) Begge parter påstår således at den anden har sendt et varsel, hvilket begge parter afviser. SATS afviser dog alligevel at tage ansvar i sagen, og dermed bekræfter SATS det, jeg skriver: At man som medlem af SATS uden varsel risikerer at blive kontaktet af deres inkassopartner.",Trustpilot

SATS,Anita Olsen,1,"Jeg har gennem de fleste år haft et firmamedlemsskab, men måtte i 2017 acceptere en kæmpe prisstigning fra 3.245 kr. årligt til 4.389 kr. årligt, da min nye arbejdsgiver ikke havde en firmaordning med Fitnessdk. Det var en kæmpeprisstigning at sluge, men jeg valgte at acceptere den, da jeg har været rigtig glad for Fitnessdk’s holdtræning og instruktører. I forbindelse med fornyelse (som jeg var indstillet på) blev jeg imidlertid konfronteret med en årlig pris på 5.748 kr. for et tilsvarende medlemskab hos nu SATS (31% prisstigning!!!).Det synes jeg er en helt urimelig prisstigning, da der er tale om et helt tilsvarende medlemskab og ikke en overgang fra virksomheds- til privat medlemskab. Det er samtidig helt ude af proportioner med priser fra sammenlignelige kæder, og derfor kommer jeg ikke til at forny for 10. år i træk.Ud over at føle at jeg har fået en helt urimelig ændring af mine vilkår, er jeg også uforståelig over for, at SATS på den måde skræmmer ellers gode, loyale kunder væk.",Trustpilot

De blev ved med at sende mig rykker selv om jeg flere gange var nede i deres center for at tilmelde mig betaling service. Der blev til sidst styr på det.MEN da jeg så melder mig ud af centeret modtager de ikke betaling fra mig IGEN på PBS som jeg selvfølelig troede der var styr på.Her næsten et år efter modtager jeg et brev fra inkasso, hvor der er kommet mange rykker på.

Jeg går ned i SATS nogle timer efter at jeg havde købt flybilletten, for man SKAL ned i deres center for at melde sig ud. Jeg fortæller den unge pige at jeg gerne vil melde mig ud, hun kigger op og ned af mig, med et arrogant halvt grinende smil og siger ""er du sikker på det?"". Hun fortæller mig at jeg har hele måneden som vi er i, og jeg stadig vil betale for kommende måned. Det er fint med mig, det står i deres betingelser, så det ved jeg godt allerede, ingen problemer der! Hun siger efterfølgende at jeg er blevet udmeldt og smiler arrogant igen og siger, ""ha en go dag søde"".Jeg har nu været på min rejse siden slut februar og jeg har betalt for et medlemskab lige siden. dette fandt jeg dog ud af, fordi jeg fik tjekket mit dankort fra Danmark. Alle mine regninger er kommet ind på min anden konto, fra en anden bank, men SATS var stadig hos min danske bank og har været trukket hver måned, hele året.Da jeg ikke fik dokumentation på at jeg udmeldte mig selv, kan jeg derfor intet gøre.

SATS,Magnus Kamarinum,1,"Fy for den!!! Efter at have været medlem i nogle måneder, uden nogensinde at benytte mig af deres træningscenter, var jeg i Juni nede i centeret for opsigelse af mit abonnoment. Det var selvfølgelig intet problem, og samtidig betalte jeg dem de penge jeg var bagud med regningen. Dette var jo selvfølgelig intet problem hellere! MEN når jeg så ringer til dem i august for at spørge hvorfor jeg stadig får regninger sendende, får jeg oplyst at jeg stadig er medlem, og at de aldrig har modtaget en opsigelse... hmm..Nåh, men jeg tænker at det måtte være en fejl, og beder om at få snakket med den der stod for min opsigelse. Det får jeg så lov til (da de godt kunne se hvem havde modtaget min betaling) og fik så oplyst af ham, at han på ingen måde kunne huske at jeg havde opsagt mit daværende abonnoment, og at jeg i givet fald skulle have underskrevet en opsigelse, som de siger at der også står oplyst i deres betingelser, som jeg har underskrevet.Da jeg var der for at oprette mig som kunde, skulle jeg underskrive noget digitalt, og da jeg spurgte hvad jeg skulle underskrive, fik jeg blot oplyst, at det kunne jeg gå ind på deres hjemmeside og se når jeg kom hjem, men hvis jeg skulle få det tilbud de havde kørende, skulle dette underskrives her og nu.. altså i blinde, da jeg ikke måtte se betingelserne.Så nu måtte jeg få opsagt mit abonnoment på ny, og blev dette selvfølgelig gjort via mail. Så jeg nu er så super heldig at have betalt for flere måneder oveni, + fået rykkergebyr og intrum ind over, da jeg jo ikke ville betale for opsagt abonnoment, og ingen hjælp fået fra Sats, på trods af flere opringninger til hovedkontoret for at prøve at finde en løsning!",Trustpilot

Rykkerbreve har betalingsfrist på 2-3 hverdage fra modtagelse af brevet (hvilket er ulovligt) og der opkræves ind i mellem ulovlige betalingsgebyrer i centrene (som kræver mange henvendelse at få tilbagebetalt).Når man som kunde beder kundeservice om at viderebringe en besked til et center er svaret at det kan de ikke medmindre man sender en mail.Der er heller ikke nogen chefer som tør stå frem og tale med kunderne - de gemmer sig bag kundeservicefolkene!SVAR TIL SATS' SVAR:Skal vi lige få sandheden ind i det her. I sendte en rykker 18. september, som PostNord leverede 26. september med betalingsfrist 1. oktober.

Jeres personale fortæller mig at der er problemer med jeres dankort-maskine og beder mig tage dokumentation med ned i centeret næste gange jeg kommer der. Jeg tager dokumentation med, men ekspedienten siger at det er løst, så jeg skal ikke gøre mere - sagen er ude af verden. MEN det er sagen så ikke og jeg kan endda betale endnu en gang og få min konto i nul uden at ekspedienten siger noget om at der mangler en betaling.

SATS,johan,1,"JEG HAR MELD MIG UD AF SATS!Efter at have været medlem i Sats/FitnessDK i ca 20 år har jeg valgt at opsige mit medlemsskab og jeg vil advare alle der bare overvejer at melde sig ind i en fitnessklub, at undgå Sats. Sats har måske for mange medlemmer og er blevet totalt ligeglade med at ""vedligeholde"" sine medlemmer.Dråben der fik bægeret at flyde over var, da jeg en aften kom ind med min lille datter for at træne (hvor centret var i stort set tomt). Her fik jeg at vide at jeg skulle betale 90 eller 100 kr hvis jeg skulle have hende med ind. Sagen er den, at man har ""altid"" haft lov til at tage en ven med. Men den fordel for s.k. ""platinmedlemmer"" er nu sløjfet fik jeg at vide. Ingen undtagelser.Dermed er den eneste måde Sats ""honorerer"" deres trofaste medlemmer gennem 20 år, ved at give 20% rabat når man køber deres tøj. Halleluja! Se det er en fordel der er til at tage og føle på!!Ingen venner med i ny og næ, ingen fringe benefits, ingen separate omklædningsrum, ingen gratis PT i nogle timer per år, ingen arrangementer. Intet.

SATS,Kunde,1,"Ifølge min tidligere anmeldelse på trustpilot fra 2 dage siden og i henhold til sats svar via trustpilot er jeg stadig dybt forarget over så en elendig kundeservice.Jeg kan se på sats svar at i helt har ""misforstået"" hvad det handler om. Hermed ridser jeg kort historien op.Jeg har tilbage i tiden. Ca 15 år været medlem af det daværende Sats, da Sats overgik til fitness dk fortsatte vi medlemskab der.For ca 1 år siden begyndte min mand og jeg at træne sammen på det nye center i Blox og der blev vi rådet til at ændre vores abonnement til "" tag en ven med"" da det blev billigere samlet for os.Da dette abonnement udløb den 28/6-19 var vi klar til forlængelse , der fik vi at vide at denne type abbonement ikke længere kunne tegnes, da fitness dk var overgået til Sats, og derfor var vi nødsaget til at oprette to abonnementer, som forlængelse af tidligere abonnement .NU KOMMER KERNEN AF DET DET HANDLER OMJeg er blevet opkrævet et oprettelses gebyr på 299,- trods mit medlemskab de sidste 15 år. Sats argument er at jeg Ikke har været medlem det sidste halve år og skal derfor oprettes på ny, hvilke i min optik er Helt forkert, da vi jo netop blev rådet til , at skifte abonnement som nu ikke længere er eksisterende.Summa summarum For mig handler det ikke Kun om de kroner 299,-Men om retorikken og kundeservice for loyale medlemmer, som ikke har valgt abonnementet skulle udgå, det er Virkelig dårlig medlemsetik, man kunne næste lade sig hen på at Sats er blevet ren drift og profit det virker som om at Sats har glemt parolen at kunden har altid ret ! Ærgerligt at i ikke taler sandt når i giver et svar, hvilke gælder både med kundeservice og jeres svar her.MvhHanne",Trustpilot
SATS,August,2,"Jeg started i vinters hos SATS Søborg, og var sådan set fint tilfreds, da det er et lækkert center med solidt udstyr. Min utilfredshed kom dog da jeg skulle udstationeres i 3 måneder og ville sætte mit medlemskab i bero. Det kunne jeg ikke få lov til.Da jeg havde travlt i ugerne op til min udstationering havde jeg desværre ikke tid til at træne, og dermed ikke tid til at sætte mit medlemskab i bero i centeret. Da vi lever i 2019 og SATS har en online portal, gik jeg ud fra det ville være nemt at sætte medlemskabet i bero. Specielt når SATS skulle være en af de mere premium fitness-kæder.Til min store overraskelse kunne man ikke gøre dette på deres portal. Man kan faktisk stort set ikke bruge portalen til noget, da man for det meste bliver henvist til at tage kontakt til medlemsservice.Jeg skriver så til SATS Søborg om jeg kan sætte mit medlemskab i bero, og forklarer at jeg er i udlandet. Jeg får intet svar i en uge, så jeg rykker i dem. Jeg får kort efter svar om at det ikke er muligt fordi de skal bruge min underskrift. Det burde de kunne klare over mail, hvilket jeg spørger om er en mulighed. Det får jeg aldrig svar på. Det er nu i slutningen af April, så jeg skynder mig at opsige mit medlemskab inden jeg skal betale for 2 måneders opsigelse i stedet for 1. Overraskende nok kan man godt opsige sit medlemskab på portalen. Hvorfor er det nemmere at opsige sit medlemskab end at sætte det i bero?Jeg sender efterfølgende en klage til SATS' hovedkontor. Jeg får svar tilbage om at min henvendelse er registreret (S 1904-3029), og jeg kan forvente svar inden for 5 hverdage. Det kommer aldrig. I mailen er det dog specificeret at man ikke kan sætte sit medlemskab i bero via e-mail. Hvorfor ikke? og hvorfor står det først hér?Så alt i alt en virkelig skuffende kundeservice, som endda nægter at svare på henvendelser, og hvis de svarer er de ikke særlig imødekommende.

SATS,Elsebeth Højgaard,1,"Nul stjerner!Jeg har været medlem i af Fitness.dk i mange år og har siden april 2019 været medlem af SATS. Jeg har oplevet utroligt meget kludder med mit medlemsskab hele tiden, men i dag tog dog prisen. Jeg kunne se på min opkrævning, at jeg bliver opkrævet 399 pr. måned, og ikke 299, som er det korrekte beløb for mit medlemskab. Jeg prøvede som det første at gå ind på mit medlemsskab på sats.dk, men kunne ikke logge ind, da jeg har ikke modtaget en adgangskode og linket 'glemt adgangskode' virkede ikke. Jeg ringede derefter til kundeservice. Da jeg forklarede, at jeg ikke kunne logge ind, sagde servicemedarbejderen som det allerførste, at 'Det er fordi du ikke vil modtage mails fra os, at du ikke har fået en adgangskode'. Jeg forklarede så, at dette ikke var korrekt - jeg har aldrig sagt, at jeg ikke ville modtage mails, og jeg har iøvrigt modtaget masser af mails - bare ikke en med mine medlemsoplysninger. Derefter sagde hun, at det er fordi jeg har et gammelt medlemsnummer - det var en helt ny oplysning for mig. Det viser sig så, at jeg åbenbart har fået et nyt medlemsnummer, men jeg er aldrig blevet oplyst om det og jeg har ikke fået et nyt medlemskort. Derefter måtte hun medgive, at de ansatte i mit fitnesscenter havde ændret mit medlemsskab til et medlemsskab, hvor jeg ganske rigtigt skal betale 299 pr måned - de havde bare ikke gjort det korrekt og betalingsoplysningerne var ikke ændret. De havde ladet mig forstå, at det nye medlemsskab var i orden, men der lå ifølge servicemedarbejderen en kontrakt, som ikke var underskrevet - og jeg har som sagt ikke modtaget en eneste mail med medlemsoplysninger.Jeg kan godt bære over med, at der bliver begået fejl, men servicemedarbejderen var under hele samtalen utrolig aggressiv - der var OVERHOVEDET ingen kundevenlighed eller nogensomhelst beklagelser af, at de har kludret så meget med mit medlemsskab. Det var som om, det var den største selvfølge i verden, at jeg ikke har modtaget de fornødne oplysninger og mails, ikke er blevet oplyst om mit nye medlemsnummer og i øvrigt er blevet opkrævet et fejlagtigt beløb. Medarbejderen var hele tiden i forsvarsposition, selvom jeg talte venligt og bare ville have sagen opklaret. Jeg synes, man i enhver kundeservice bør have medarbejdere ansat, som er gearet til at tale venligt med kunder - og som kan gøre indrømmelser, når der er blevet begået ekstremt mange fejl.Og så synes jeg i øvrigt som mange andre, at oprettelsesgebyrerne hos SATS er urimelige. Servicemedarbejderen, jeg talte med i dag, pointerede netop, at problemet med mit medlemsnummer var opstået, fordi det ikke var et nyt medlemsskab, jeg havde tegnet, men et gammelt fitness.dk-medlemsskab, jeg havde fornyet. Alligevel måtte jeg betale 299 i oprettelsesgebyr. Jeg synes, det svarer til, at man skal betale ved indgangen til en forretning for at få lov til at komme ind og være kunde - jeg synes, de burde afskaffes helt.",Trustpilot

I omklædningen ser jeg straks, at skabenes låsemekanisme er ændret til nu at kræve en hængelås. Jeg returnerer til receptionen for at låne en hængelås. Den kunne jeg så leje for 10 kroner eller købe min egen. Jeg forklarer, at jeg er besøgende på dagsbillet og at jeg rent faktisk havde forhørt mig dagen i forvejen om sådanne eventuelle detaljer. Svaret fra Michael i receptionen: “Ja, og man skal også have træningstøj med!”Det var så dråben for mig.

Jeg er dog svært skuffet over at man som tilbagevendende medlem, igen skal betale 299 i oprettelse. Det er en unødvendigt og useriøst tiltag, der udover at tilbageholde tidl. medlemmer i at komme igen også er en utrolig dårlig oplevelse at starte ud med. Taget konkurrencen i betragtning, burde SATS stå med åbne arme og tage imod tilbagevendende kunder. Dette er dog desværre ikke tilfældet og gør jeg annulleret mit medlemskab.",Trustpilot

SATS,Finn Wichmann Lund,1,"RINGE MEDLEMSSERVICE OG INGEN FORRETNINGSMORALSats ønsker at etablere et brand som et Premium Træningscenter, men det fejler fuldstændigt når det kommer til deres Medlemsservice.Sats Medlemsservice er drevet af princip, hvor manglende selvindsigt og dårlig forretningsmoral er i højsædet. Min datter havde indmeldt sig i januar, men måtte i marts erkende at hun på grund af sygdom ikke ville få brugt sit abonnement (det har jeg tilbudt Sats at dokumentere). Vi går derfor ned i centeret hvor vi beder om at medlemskabet skal stoppe hurtigst muligt – og da betingelserne er løbende måned + 30 dage, kan det ikke ske før udgangen af april. Det må vi jo så acceptere.Da vi kommer ind i maj får vi pludselig en ny opkrævning fra Sats, som viser sig at omfatte maj – så vi tager ned i centeret for at undersøge sagen (min datter har ikke på noget tidspunkt brugt sit abonnement, hvilket Sats også bekræfter), og vi får nu oplyst at min dattes abonnement er sat til at udløbe med august. Og altså ikke hurtigst muligt!!Vi får oplyst at vi skal henvende os til deres medlemsservice – og det er her det bliver rigtigt sjovt, for vi forventede jo at Sats hurtigt ville indse at de havde begået en fejl, men det blev hurtigt til en lang og frusterende mail udveksling med deres Medlemsservice-chef, ”Julie”. ”Julie” ønskede ikke på noget tidspunkt at forholde sig til den mulighed, at Sats havde begået en fejl – men derimod bad os om at dokumentere at vi havde ønsket at opsige med udgangen af april, idet hun hævder at vi har fået en kvittering. Dette har hun fortsat ikke ønsket at bevise. Hun er samtidig af den overbevisning at vi vil synes at det har været en fantastisk oplevelse at have været kunde hos Sats, da hun vælger at godskrive os den ene af de måneder som fejlen har påført os.Det er mig en gåde at Sats har en strategi om at kunden skal betale uanset hvad, i stedet for at at sikre en god kundeoplevelse, i tilfælde hvor kunden er kommet i klemme i forbindelse en rigtig træls situation, hvor alle andre leverandører normalt ville lade tvivlen komme kunden til gode.Da jeg var nede at betale for medlemsskabet i sidste uge, var de 2 Sats medarbejder pinlige berørt over sagen – så i det mindste er det umiddelbart kun ”Julie” og deres Medlemsservice der har et problem.Fejl sker alle steder og hele tiden – men ikke at ville indrømme det i en sag der burde være åbenlys, må jo skyldes at de enten har de forkerte mennesker ansat, eller at deres forretningsmoral ikke er i sync med det brand de forsøger at opbygge som et Premium Træningscenter.",Trustpilot

Jeg er medlem på Frederiksberg Allé og har aldrig afleveret pant for udlevering af håndklæde, jeg ved dog der findes denne regel. Men kundeservice, kære Sats, må give muligheder for at differencer disse regler, når jeres medarbejdere ikke altid er i skranken. Dette betyder at jeg skal vente for at få min pant retur. Der er en klokken man kan ringe på, men personalet kan måske ikke høre den?Udover dette er der så varmt pga. dårlig aircondition at man i dag skulle have delt vand og håndklæder ud gratis. Jeg forventer ikke andet svar end at sådan er reglerne, men så tillykke med jeres manglende fleksibilitet.Stoppede forresten mit kontingent, men hvad betyder det for jer, formentlig ingenting.Thomas Viskum",Trustpilot

Jeg vil tilslutte mig dem, der ratede SATS Danmark med en enkelt stjerne. Og det er selvfølgelig fordi man ikke har muligheden for at afgive ""et nul"". Firmaet lokkede i begyndelse af året med ""gratis medlemskab"" med efterfølgende gjorde det svært for medlemmer at fortyde eller udmelde. For mit vedkommende skyldtes det, at jeg skulle på en rejse, der ville adskillige uger. Det lykkedes ekspedienten at overtale mig til at ""vilende medlemskab"" med en del af betalingen. Da jeg siden bestemte mig at bringe dette noget ulykkeligt forhold til ophør, erfarede jeg, at SATS Danmarks hjemmeside vanskeliggjorde processen. Blandt andet fik man en DREJENDE TANDHJUL efter der blev trykt INDSEND.Så er der også det der ""står med småt"" - hvilket jeg gerne gør folk opmærksom på - er at udmeldingen altid betinges med LØBENDE PLUS ÉN MÅNED. Dette gav anledning til at jeg nu sidder med to rykker som desværre ikke hænger sammen: Rykker 1 forfalder den 26/5 378kr. inkl. rykkegebyr 100kr.Rykker 2 forfalder den 28/5 578kr. ! inkl. rykkergebyr 100kr. (hvordan f**** ikke 478 med 578kr!!)Min telefon henvendelse d.d. den 4/6 afslører at jeg nu allerede skylder firmaet 878kr. !!SATS Danmark har for mig kun ""krone-tegn"" i øjnene og nærmest afpresser pengene ud af folk. Det er ok med lokketilbud Facebook, måske ok at instruere sine medarbejdere med vildledning af medlemmet der er på vej ud, men frækt nok at vanskeliggør udmeldingsprocedurerne og uforskammet i at true sig til betalingen jvf. ovenfor.

Det betød at de penge der var indsat på kontoen pludselig var væk og der var udsted en rykker fra SATS med henblik på for sen betaling.SATS påstod at der var sendt en mail med information om manglende betaling, men da de ikke på noget tidpunkt havde en mail-adresse registreret var dette en direkte løgn.I denne forbindelse blev han meldt ud, også uden at være informeret om dette.Efter ca. 10 henvendelser i SATS hørsholm med både medarbejdere og ledere involveret, og gentagne opkald til medlemsservice er det nu blevet for meget.Tidligere på ugen fik vi at vide at de penge der var blevet væk fra kontoen var fundet og betalingen via disse kunne genoptages. 2 dage senere modtager vi en rykker grundet manglende betaling.

SATS,Carina Petersen,1,"Hej SATSJeg er meget uforstående over for den måde, I behandler jeres medlemmer på. Jeg trænede i FitnessDk, som automatisk overgik til SATS i starten af det nye år (kan ikke huske den præcise dato). Jeg får nyt betalingskort i starten af januar. Forsøger i første omgang at tjekke, om man kan ændre sine betalingsoplysninger på jeres hjemmeside - det kan man ikke - man skal kontakte sit lokale center. Det gør jeg og får ændret det hele til mit nye kort. Jeg har altid betalt 238 for at træne i ét center og kun med almindelig fitness. 1. marts trækker I mig så 561,65 kr. Jeg kontakter det lokale center, som ikke kan se, hvad det skyldes, og beder mig om at kontakte medlemsservice. Da jeg ringer i dag, får jeg at vide, at jeg selv aktivt har været inde at ændre mit abonnement til et dyrere abonnement tilbage i januar - det har jeg IKKE. Hun vil ikke trække betalingen tilbage, da det jo umuligt kan være sket af sig selv. Regningen kommer 1. marts i stedet til at lyde på 443,- da jeg stadig skal betale for den tid, hvor jeg har haft det dyre abonnement. Jeg spørger så, om man ikke får en bekræftelse, når man er inde at ændre sit abonnement. Det gør man så ikke. Derfor har jeg ikke haft den tanke, at der skulle være noget galt, da jeg både 1. januar og 1. februar har betalt 238 kr. Det lokale center havde haft lignende tilfælde med tidligere FitnessDK-abonnementer, som pludselig får en større regning, fordi de har ændret i deres medlemskab. Fremover skal jeg så betale 249 frem for 238, fordi hun ikke kan lave det om til de gamle betingelser. Det er, hvad det er, men jeg kan slet slet ikke forstå, hvorfor jeg skal betale 443. Det er totalt bondefangeri. I sådan en situation have det været meget bedre at slette betalingen og rette den til 249 til betaling 1. marts. Føler mig ikke særlig godt behandlet og har ikke den store lyst til at fortsat at være en del af SATS, når man slet ikke kan se, at der er tale om en fejl/misforståelse. Man kan se, at jeg har trænet i weekenden SELV i det pågældende center, hvorfor skulle jeg have lavet mit abonnement om og ikke gøre brug af så dyrt et abonnement?! I bør virkelig sørge for, at folk får besked, når der sker ændringer i deres medlemskab. Det andet er på ingen måde i orden - man har ikke en chance.",Trustpilot
SATS,Oliver Neumann,1,"I forbindelse med et medlemsskab hos fitnessdk, nu STAS, satte jeg 2400 kroner ind på en ""konto"" med det formål at have en personlig træner 4 gange. For ikke at fastholde et abonnement jeg ikke fik brugt, opsagde jeg samtidig med oprettelsen abonnementet. Da omstændighederne gjorde at jeg i de fire måneder jeg havde abonnementet ikke fik brugt det, som forventet, brugte jeg heller ikke den personlige træner.Abonnementet udløb d. 31/12-18 og efter kun at have brugt den personlige træner én gang, var der jo 3/4 af pengene tilbage.

There was far too much ""real"" Cuba, which in reality was about the family of Yosvany (owner of the dance school) being able to come to a free party at our expense.
If people did not want to invite their dance partner out in the evening, these people were looked down upon.
And division in the group, which took the form of direct bullying of individual people in the group, nothing was done about it.
People simply behaved disgustingly towards each other and the organizer ""Cuban Dance School"" did nothing, they were more busy taking care of family matters.

There was a status meeting every morning before classes, which was a good way to align expectations and evaluate. There was a good atmosphere in the group and I have made some friends for life. We partied, danced and shared robber stories for 10 days and lived very well just behind Obispo. Yosvanny's brother made sure we always knew which groups were playing which Caasas De La Musíca. Thursdays were reserved for dancing at 1800. The included trips were great. It was a very moving experience to be at a Tambor with Yosvanny's mother who opened her home to us to give us a Cuban experience. The Cuban food was really good – especially the Cardosa.

Other,Josefine Jensen,1,"Bought proof downtown and was looking forward to loosening up, but have to admit it's the worst massage I've ever had. Dirty sheets/carpets filled with animal hair, heavily perfumed room without ventilation. Was supposed to have a 60 min massage. I think luckily she only gave me 50 minutes.
Already 20 minutes into the treatment, it seemed as if she had run through her program and was just filling in the remaining time - with strange pressures and very little overview, even though she had only taken one page. Never experienced such painful massage either. Had to remind myself to breathe several times because the pain was so intense from her massage and her movements felt incredibly stressed and fast which made it impossible to 'be' in the pain. She also massaged using a yellow tool she held in her hand, it felt like she was using a stone. Was in before lunch, and this evening my body is screaming and my muscles are cramping all the way up. Can barely move.
And then she also massaged my scalp, with oil, which then just sat in the hair, she tried to dry it, however, with a towel, which she just ran around my hair - perhaps would have liked to know, I should have had a brush with me, since at least I didn't leave the room in a presentable way.
And then she complained quite a lot about downtown - despite the fact that she herself has chosen to make an offer through them.

- We told the staff but nobody helped in our 4-day stay. They said they would but did not.

I guess, the experience depends on the room. Our room had all the problems listed above. But maybe other rooms don't. But I can surely say that I won't spend this much money to try again. I would even pay more to get other very good hotels nearby. Bye bye DGI Byens.",Google

Luckily I didn’t do it and double checked with the orthopedic doctor who confirmed this is likely to cause harm so soon after surgery.

I shared the feedback with Mathias who treated me and he unfortunately waved it off with the argument that the surgeon likely got it wrong as he is probably not up to date on pain management and training.

Both the treatment itself and the reaction to my feedback was very disappointing and based on this I cannot recommend Elitefysio.

Overall, I did not feel any significant or long lasting relief and have spent quite a big sum of money and have eventually stopped going after experiencing worsening of my symptoms.

The coffee was served in the cozy fireplace room, while space was made for a dance floor in the hall. Perfect with two rooms so you can sit and talk in between, a bit of peace for music and the dance floor. I think it made many people stay a little longer than usual.

Unfortunately, some personal items were removed from my room during my stay.  I was credited 500DKK which was a kind gesture but I was still concerned about potentially broken protocols or policies that needed to be revisited.  For example, I had the Do Not Disturb (DND) sign on the door but housekeeping still entered.  Also, there was a camera over my door which apparently showed all activity at my door throughout the day and night.  I was promised I could see the video of footage during the day my items went missing but due to a communication issue among staff, the video was deleted before I had an opportunity to see it.

I reached out to the front office manager, who I worked with from the start of the incident, and the director to try to get two concerns addressed: 1) If housekeeping still enters the room to empty the trash when the DND sign is on the door, please inform guests so they know what the DND sign means at Charlottehaven, and, 2)  I suggested that when there is an incident under investigation, it would be good to have a protocol in place to retain the video that may useful in the investigation for longer than the default 3-day period.  Note: I reached out a few times to see the video before the 3-day expiration.

In an attempt to resolve my concerns before posting this review, I reached out to resolve or at least receive acknowledgement of the underlying issues needing attention related to my experience with invasion of privacy.

Like the other public pools in Denmark that I’ve visited, there’s no front desk. You just buy your swim pass from a machine in the front (credit cards accepted) and get a wristband. You’re required to shower before putting on your swimsuit, and everyone seemed to comply. Lockers are free to use and automated (you just put a pin on the screen to open/close)—no need to bring your own lock.

Overall, great neighborhood pool to swim laps.",Google
Other,Adrián Moreno Peña,4,"Public swimming pool, with a coupe of lines for faster swimming (“hurtige svømmen”), and a couple of double-lanes for “motion swimming”. That is for the times where it’s open to the public - it’s best to check the website (as some times it’s booked for clubs or associations).

It can get busy at some hours. The good part is that you can check how busy it is from outside (so you can decide if you skip the swim in case it’s too full).

There are lockers in the changing rooms. They work with a code (so no coin or lock is required).

There are lifeguards on duty in the side of the pool. The access is done with an automated payment machine in the entrance (you can pay by credit card or mobile pay), which dispenses a self-adhesive bracelet that serves as ticket.

There is also an infrared sauna (temporarily closed in the winter of 2022 due to the energy prices and electricity availability).",Google

However, I found that my physical therapist could not remember what injury I had and I had to repeat several times what exercises he had given me. I understand that there can be a degree of uncertainty in relation to diagnosis, but the programming itself lacked clear structure and seemed haphazard.

There were times when he was surprised that I was still doing certain exercises. When the course was completed, I was simply advised to ""try my way"" without a clearly defined plan on how to get back to my previous level. Despite the 7 sessions, the therapist had neglected to look at my body as a whole, resulting in an imbalance as I had overcompensated for a long period of time. I later ended up going to another physiotherapist who diagnosed a secondary injury that I am now struggling with.

Other,Kenn Dencker,1,"If I could give 0 stars here, I would.

I recently had my last temporary job at Fælledgården. It is to my great regret that I even agreed to begin with.
I have NEVER experienced such incompetence from nursing home management.
Hanna and Bettina should NEVER have had the positions they hold. The 2 in particular treat several of their permanent employees and not least their replacements as slaves. They overburden their permanent employees/substitutes and demand that they can multitask and be in several places at the same time, and the corona situation only makes it even more chaotic. The majority of the responsibility for those affected by the corona falls on the house's replacements and temps rather than the permanent employees.
I would also like to mention here the completely insane corona restrictions that they set up for their employees and which, by the way, are not seen anywhere else. They require a mask or visor upon arrival at Fælledgården and in all the common areas and in the residents' homes. These requirements can of course be both accepted and respected to a certain extent.
Furthermore, the staff may only eat and drink in the offices and all belongings must be stored either in the wardrobes in the basement or in the office. It could also easily be accepted if only the management itself complied with all these rules and requirements. The center manager can, for example, is seen walking around with his cup of coffee throughout the house without a mask or visor, where is the justice in that?? But there is apparently a hierarchy which acquits the boss and other higher employees of such regulations. The worst part, however, is that it goes beyond the residents who live in the wards where the chaos is clearly noticeable.

So if you have loved ones, you will find another care centre.",Google

Seeing his old ""carnivorous"" father eating beetroot leaves and pesto is profoundly strange. And juice me here and juice me there.
The place is probably no worse than other care centers, but that is little consolation.
""cooperation"" on important things is non-existent.

I had PT sessions with Niko alongside the Hiit classes and have really enjoyed it. Over the last 4 months Niko has really helped me with training, strength building and losing weight. I am feeling a lot more confident and body positive. Training with Niko has been fun and really rewarding, he helped with meal plans and I'm lifting weights I never thought was possible for me.

Highly recommend the sessions for all levels from beginner to advanced.

Great place.",Google
Other,Grace Lam,3,"I went to the ""newbie"" full body workout a couple weeks ago. As I hadn't worked out for several months prior, I ended up overexerting myself and was hospitalized with a severe case of rhabdomyolysis, which, if not treated, can cause kidney failure. This wasn't the studio's fault, although I feel that the class I went to was too intense for something aimed at newbies. I emailed them afterwards to inform them that I had been hospitalized. I also suggested to them that in the future they might consider warning beginners of the well-documented risks of high-intensity workouts and easing them more slowly into HIIT. However, I received no reply, which seems rather unprofessional.

The instructors are friendly and encouraging, but if you're not used to high-intensity workouts, be aware of the risks and don't push yourself overly hard.",Google

Other,Pernille Jørgensen,1,"My boy was really looking forward to it, and there was nothing about payment. never mind the DKK 150 I paid, but I had signed him up for a walkin trial class, on a ""junior beginner team"" with Amalie as teacher,? there were so many teenage girls on the team, which clearly the vast majority had had many hours, someone was flirting but the teacher stood giggling and was disturbing right next to Min Dreng.. (Could have just moved him somewhere else😥 ) and a single talented boy, my boy's age. My boy was of course shy, but really tried his best, there was no help from the dance teacher Mark (who, before they started, said that I could just come and try out on Monday, because it was a boys' team, even though it said Tuesday junior team) but only attention"" to the others. NOT very pedagogical style, when all children who have to dance for the first time between strangers and other big children probably needed support and a little praise, then the desire to try again ,would be reinforced. My boy struggled with inexperience and I had to PRAISE HIM all evening and the next day to boost his confidence. My boy otherwise has a good approach to all new things. I imagine how a slightly shy child must have that in the same situation😔 only one star, and hope their attitude improves🙏",Google
Other,Cordelia Malene L. Møgelgaard,1,"Bad customer service!!! That dance school is only after people's money. I started in the middle of January and had been paying for half a year. But paid for two lessons more than I could achieve as the month was already half way through. Only managed 4 dance hours, then I was on holiday, so I got a few hours in. Then corona happened. Since they reopened, I have been on sick leave and hospitalized, so have not been able to catch up on the dance lessons that I am entitled to, as I have paid for half a year's worth of lessons.

Called in and explained my situation. But was just told it wasn't their problem. They may be right about that. But I think it would have been good style and customer service to just give me half of my lessons for good or similar.

Can't really recommend spending your money on this dance school!",Google

Other,Anne Pedersen,5,"Brønshøj Fit&Sund is, to date, the very best place I've had a fitness membership. Rarely, if ever, have I experienced such a cozy and nice atmosphere among the employees and users (myself included). I have had (and have) great pleasure from the booty strength class, which physiotherapist student Sarah holds every Monday. I have learned a great deal in the team, and she is incredibly thorough and skilled at guiding and giving advice and guidance. I have also had a few private training sessions with Karim who also provides the best guide and is extremely good at what he does! It is such a pleasure to be met by such friendly staff, and then you get some fantastic teammates on the teams you participate in. At least on the ones I've trained on. I can also recommend the calisthenics class on Wednesdays, which Jens organizes. He really does that very well, and you are really taken by the hand, despite the fact that some of the exercises seem impossible, you really find out that the body can do more than you think. Huge kudos to him too!
Brønshøj fit&sund can really be proud and happy of their employees, because they do a fantastic job to make the atmosphere in the center fantastic. I really love coming there, because you get in a really good mood, and the training facilities are also just tip top! Big praise to you, from a very satisfied user. :-)
