Birch Poulsen,3,"I exercise early in the morning and start before staff arrives. A fine arrangement that can be done. Now, however, I have experienced my card twice in the past while having been rejected by a technique error that I cannot get an explanation for. I have had the card checked and it is not a problem. I have to wait for the neighborhood to go before you can use the card again. Here I have come in, but it is annoying. The first time this happened I had my membership card exchanged, but the same mistake repeated with the new one.",PureGym

Kjetil Nordin,1,"There is no improvement, and they just owe it to them not to own the building themselves, and that building owners do not allow ventilation. There has been really bad air for a month now, and it is simply too bad for a fitness centre. The air quality means quite a lot when you stand on treadmills. There is a need for a quick solution, because it is really hard to take off to work out in the indoor climate.Edited after answers:Center management, employees and puregym have already been contacted several times during October.

Steffen Martinsen,2,"Unfortunately this morning I have had a rather bad experience of your customer service at Jens Baggesensvej in Aarhus. I work out in the morning and arrive at the center at 7 a.m., where I find out that I have unfortunately forgotten my card. No problem I think, because I know that there are always staff who clean up and fill up goods etc., who must be able to help poor me. A personal trainer is behind the box and accepts my message, and goes down to the staff who are doing the cleaning downstairs. Two minutes later he comes back and tells me that they can't help when they first serve customers from 8 a.m. so I could just wait an hour. I thought that was a terrible experience and I'm going to report out of the center because of it.",PureGym

Mehdi Esfahani,2,"OK place to train but I'm not impressed with the service. For example, I really like that there are offers for coffee in most centers. But time and again I get annoyed that there is no possibility to cook some water for coffee and there are no staff available when you call them in their opening hours. Then they're always ""meetings."" That's enough for me to think about signing up! Hope it gets to the right person, so it becomes a constructive input instead of sour upbringing.

Avni Hasani,1,"I've been trying to work out in PureGym Vejlevej, Fredericia. My card has been jammed due to a situation that happened 3 days ago. I could understand on the manager who was working today (26/10/23 at 13.30) that the head office has decided to banish me for 2 years for threats which is the lie. Furthermore, the manager said that there is no sound on the surveillance but that I have threatened one of the members The right version is that I was pushed and threatened by a member who is clearly on steroids in PureGym. He was pushing me away and threatened me violently. The police came and questioned us both. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and did not want to look at the monitoring and assessed that he was not allowed to use both machines at the same time. But according to this manager's the head office will want to make a decision anyway. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and would not look at the monitoring and decided that there was no push on the threat or like. But the video.

There are two women in the bike room who have really loud music, I go in and nicely ask if they won't turn down, where one of them breaks out that it's only for an hour and that they should be allowed to be here, I explain that the same thing applies to me and she just keeps repeating itself, so I just go out again. Later I get an email with a warning because of my inappropriate advice and then find out that one of the two women was a director. I don't get the opportunity to defend myself and tell my side and try to send a complaint to the member service, but also gets rejected and get a short answer to keep the warning. It's pure principle for me and it's so unfair, I've been a member for 10 years + and always behaved properly. To be treated like this after all ",PureGym

Jesper,4,"I am generally happy with SATS, especially after having better opening hours. Sweet employees and usually good atmosphere on the ""floor."" However, there are some things that could be improved, including faster repair times of defective machines. 2-3 weeks is not all right, but unfortunately often a reality. Besides, you rarely see receptionists more, as these have apparently been given other tasks such as cleaning and cleaning up. I have also seen people go straight into my regular centre several times, without checking in, so unfortunately I also suspect cheating due to the often lack of reception staff. On the wish list is a SATS center in Hillerød:-) Otherwise I am perfectly satisfied with the 2 centres (BLOX and ABC) which I use primarily",SATS
Tyge H. Christensen,3,"I had my first training in SATS valby about 10 years ago, the equipment is to today's date pretty much the same as then, i.e. it's all pretty worn out, especially the cable racks.The sauna is also downgraded with quality over time, and there's generally ugly and there's smells, people are some pigs and it's not SATS to blame that there's sniffing and all snooping on the floor but is being cleaned in there every day?You might doubt that.The running machines, on the other hand, are really good, but it's also the only praise I have to the center right now. I've quit my subscription down there because I don't feel it't worth the money, it would have been cheaper, such about half price then I might have kept my subscription.",SATS
Fleur,4,"I am incredibly satisfied with SATS! The staff always seems polite and welcoming, the center is clean and neat, and there is a good culture among users to respect 'public space'. The sauna is amazing, and the changing is always nice and clean. There are many different kinds of teams, and the team trainers seem extremely competent and present. My only criticism, however, goes on the waiting lists for the teams, often there are over 30 people on the waiting list for popular teams for several weeks out in the future, and it makes it difficult to plan your training. Especially when you are at the top of the waiting list an existing day and have to stay'ready' for if you get space. I am aware that it is not SATS' 'guilty', although it is just great that their team is so popular, but it is unfortunately rather impractical and small annoying for us, who just really want to grow a lot of Gravity.But everything in everything I am extremely satisfied!",SATS
Lene Sinding,1,"Sats Glostrup for your info: Once again, breaking into a locker in men's dress and car has been stolen.When you're standing on a treadmill you can see that more people just go in without signing in and are pretty sure they don't pay a quota.

Peter Ladefoged,1,"After being a customer of SATS and always paying my bills (for overpriced) for 7 years, I changed my cell phone last month after I was hired by a new company. This meant that my bill was not paid on time - my mistake 100%. However, the next thing that happened was that SATS sent me directly to Indrum - an debt collection company of the worst drawer.

Helle Smidt,1,"It seems that SATS only focuses on the large centres, for example in inner Copenhagen. I train among others in Vallensbæk. I have trained on the team with functional training for more than 5 years - the director is great. Now the team is closed with the reason that there are not enough participants on the team. No, there are no waiting lists on the team, debt offers quality and social cohesion. That's exactly what the smaller centres can offer, but it's obviously not a factor in SATS unfortunately.",SATS

Steen Lange,1,Very negative. Instructor on Saturday's boxing team Glostrup rate played so loud music that it is intolerable to sit on the exercise bike in adjacent locals. Instructor was asked if it was possible to turn down the music a bit as it is not possible to close doors to the room. It became a clear no if we had problems with this we could just contact customer service and complain. Instead she deliberately raised the music and had a party. We had to leave Sats as it was not possible to keep outParking the square is 150m. From the center there one could hear the music dunking,SATS

Christoffer Hilton,1,"In the period when I was at Sats, it wasn't always that sauna or the cold shower worked. The cables also broke often, and it took a long time before it was fixed. It was a period of austerity, and a hard economy, so that's what it is. However, it's still not optimal.What really suits me is that I could no longer train, so I would quit my subscription. Sats offer me 2 months of rest free. I accept that.I find out that I can no longer train, so I say the abonnoment up. It also means that the rest state is terminated, and that I have to pay from today's date of +1 month.

Sanket,4,"It's a shame that so fine service delivered yesterday and today to my wife and I - by Liv and Oliver in the *helsinore department, is technically complicated (computer) due to a problematic registration due to it's a campaign offer. You should be told that it takes about 20-25 minutes to sign up before you say ""yes thanks"" to the offer. Too bad that Dankort's machine doesn't funk when you try both with chip and wireless and you have to sign up through the iPad. Skranke service should be faster - but it's just not and it's a shame when you have such skilled and service minded staff. Thanks a lot to Life and Oliver and all the technical stuff can go somewhere. Therefore minus a star. The offer in itself is fine and I look forward very much to an hour with Christian who has been recommended by several from SATS.",SATS
Mikkel Vallesholm,1,"(The review is written after 8 visits to the center over period of two months. In addition, I have a roommate who uses the center considerably more often, who has the same experience) There is a lack of general management of the center, otherwise it wouldn't be so bad... There is a lack of consistent hand alcohol in half of dispensations. - All toilets are grossly disgusting. It looks like no toilets are checked more than 2-3 times a day, which is absurd when you think of the amount of people who use the center daily. Staff should go a round every hour in peak hours, but move rarely from the counter, even when there are more at work. In addition, the toilets smell like a lack of basic cleaning (other than emptying the trash can and cleaning mirror) - no water vending machines, which means that you are forced into disgusting toilets to fill your small water bottle. - Several cabinets in the men's dressing room do not work, which means that it can be difficult to find a closet in any way.",SATS
Rasmus Christian �stergaard,1,"I ask if the music can be turned down a bit when I work out at the center. Only in the evening when there are few guests left and almost everyone hears sound in their own headphones. Typically, the employee says of course and turns down a little. This evening I saw that they turned up higher instead of turning down - when I asked for the second time. At 9.15 p.m. and pretty much everyone heard their own sound. But there was a group of employees hanging out in the desk. (together with what emerged as a group of friends) All my family appreciates training in the center and we use our own personal trainers. But today I experienced a flabet and unengaged service (in particular from one of the employees) It was more important that the staff had a party than that they as a guest felt welcome.I wanted a handshake of the employee as a sort of regret. And possibly in making it clear whether it was reasonable to ask for the music?",SATS

Gabriel,1,"Keeping an eye on your bills - SATS likes to add extra payments without informing you about it.Your systems are in such a poor condition that they remove campaign benefits. In my case, it gave an extra bill on a month's subscription. Furthermore, they provide in the centers a wrong guide when it comes to setting up payment methods. If you sign up after 14th of the month, you must add payment methods to the center so that they can use the chosen method for the coming month. I was told in the center that I should just have done it before the next 14.Your payment department by phone is fairly cold and indifferent to their centers providing incorrect information upon registration. As well as that their systems impose extra payment without it being written anywhere.All in all this is not a business that I personally would trust.

It's very dirty and disgusting. It doesn't smell good. The saun itself needs a look through. The glass door doesn't close so it doesn't get really hot. It's constantly humid in there and not a dry heat like it should be in a sauna. The wood bench is almost rotten and the bottom part is about to fall off with nails looking forward. Last time I was there was toilet paper on the floor underneath the bench and the floor was characterized by not having been cleaned for long. It's mildly disgusting and disgusting to use your facilities and the price taken into consideration for the fitness subscription with you vs. other offers it's not okay. I hope it's soon it's fixed.

As a minus I think that many of the centers are now in need of a thorough renovation/upgrade. There's no ""luxus"" over SATS longer than other centers. Changing the two centers where I work out is very worn out, the showers are bad. And the machines are very long to be made when they break - a ""technician is called"" sign can sit long time on a machine before the error is corrected....

Martim Bøf Moniz,2,"This review is valid for SATS Falkones at Frederiksberg.There are too many trainers in outdoor shoes and who don't change at all, and if they do, they don't do it in the dressing room, but in the training room, or in the halls for team training. It makes the floor dirty, and it's a little sad when you get yourself into clean indoor shoes. There are also some lockers in the lockers where the doors are pulled off. They have been for months, therefore it would be nice to have them put back on again.There is either no air conditioning in the first part of the center, where machines are trained, or also it doesn't work.The music in the center is often Ganta rap, or hip hop. Thinking more that you should try much music that goes to a wider audience. The group of young people who hear that kind of music doesn't already have earphones in their ears, so they don't hear it ",SATS
