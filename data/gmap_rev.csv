We then ordered a water. When we then have to pay, they demand DKK 350 from us, as the wine was obviously not included, which we are very surprised by.
It totally ruined the experience for us! It's really critical that they haven't included their employee in the menu when that was pretty much what everyone got this evening! Leaving there with a great feeling of having been robbed.",{},,,,,,,

Then duck years that were also cool and with completely inadequate accessories. A spoonful of mashed potatoes :-(
We hoped until the end that they could save some of the glory with Ris ala manden which we were supposed to have for dessert. Here, too, we were confirmed that we will never set foot in this restaurant again. It had been produced several days before and had pulled the skin - it was a decidedly embarrassing affair for the restaurant. Fortunately, it was a good experience to see the concert hall itself. And the only reason they didn't get only 1 star was that the service was quite reasonable :-)",{},,,,,,,

What, together with the subsequent concert, should have been an all-round experience for a group of people who normally cannot afford this, was marked by a dull start with stressed and cranky service. The vegetarian dishes had to be pre-ordered, we were told, and the waiter said it was on the website. It didn't - and I've just checked for the third time, it says nothing about that! Not even in the nice emails we received leading up to our visit was there anything about this. After some ping-pong, the waiter offered to inquire in the kitchen about what was possible and reported back that they could handle one vegetarian main course. Thank you! When we asked for extra bread, we were told that we had received three baskets with four loaves in each - so one for each 😉. Yes, it was true, but that's why you can ask for more. It was the whole tone that was boring. We felt inconvenienced and not welcome.

- a bread basket with four small airy buns
- a bowl filled with humus - on the lid a slightly strange fish dish
- a bowl with 2-3 slices of Parma ham, on the lid a small dry onion pie
- a bowl with 8-9 olives and a little artichoke - on the lid smoked cheese with a little cucumber
The price for the glory was DKK 190 per person, which was very expensive compared to the somewhat meager meal. If there had been more bread, it would have helped the experience, so you would have had something to use the very large portion of humus and smoked cheese for.",{},,,,,,,

The ingredients are fresh and there are plenty. I already ate half before remembering to take a picture for the review.
Also the only way I can describe the dough is that I've never had such a perfect blend of crusty and creamy. Like it comes from an old signature family recipe.

The owner is so wholesome and passionate it makes the athmosphere more welcoming than anything I've experienced before.

From the moment we walked in, it was evident that the guy running the restaurant, presumably the owner, had no interest in serving customers. We made the mistake of arriving just 30 minutes before closing, and it seemed like he couldn't wait to shut down and go home.
To make matters worse, despite my boyfriend trying to be polite and ask about the pizzas in three different ways, this guy responded with sheer rudeness, threatening to kick us out if we dared say hello one more time.The restaurant itself was nothing to write home about either. It had an outdated, shabby appearance that made us question whether proper maintenance was ever done. Clearly, the owner didn't care about the overall ambiance or making guests feel welcome.

I must say, the customer service was the worst I've ever experienced. If you value being treated with respect and receiving good service, do yourself a favor and avoid this place.  Save yourself the trouble and find a restaurant that actually cares about its customers. The Pasta House is an absolute disaster and a perfect example of what not to do in the hospitality industry.

Had booked and arrived on time, no-one at the desk with the booking book so waited patiently.

Occasionally the manager would look over in this direction.

Slowly other people arrived, until a queue of four people were waiting to be seated.

The manager dealt with a takeaway, took a couple of takeaway orders on the phone, and during quiet moments would look around the restaurant scowling.

Periodically looking at the queue of people, but not reacting in any way at the patiently waiting customers.

Eventually a harassed waitress, between serving tables, came to see what the guests wanted.

Upon checking the booking she started leading me in, at which point the manager scowled, loudly proclaiming she was waiting for a group of 5 people and was full.

Upon being informed I had a booking, she scowled again, and angrily gestured at an empty table.

The helpful and friendly waitress prepared the table and showed me to the seat with a menu.

20 more minutes later, with no sign of an order being taken (which appeared to be the case at multiple tables), I left.

The place looked lovely, but the unpleasant attitude and disdainful approach displayed by the manager was astonishing.

I have no idea about the food as 30 minutes essentially ignored for a pre-booked table was too much for me.","{'Tuesday': '05:00PM - 11:00PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00PM - 11:00PM', 'Thursday': '05:00PM - 11:00PM', 'Friday': '05:00PM - 11:00PM', 'Saturday': '05:00PM - 11:00PM', 'Sunday': '05:00PM - 11:00PM'}",,05:00PM - 11:00PM,05:00PM - 11:00PM,05:00PM - 11:00PM,05:00PM - 11:00PM,05:00PM - 11:00PM,05:00PM - 11:00PM

Service ignored us pretty much all evening unless we raised a hand and waved for them.

I'd honestly expect better of an inhouse hotel restaurant.

I can warmly recommend the wine paring to compliment the food - they have done an excellent job, to 'upgrade' the experience!

The set menu for the evening, took us through a suite of meats: shellfish, fish, poultry and game meat, all nicely prepared.

Only two things to point out:

- The first serving of appetizers went a bit too fast as we had no wine served to match the food. In my view the drinks needs to be served first, before any dishes are served.

- The other point is when a dish is described with ingredients highlighted, then I expect you are able to taste them. Example we had a starter dish with apricot, but the taste didn't really surface. Probably because the dish was too small or maybe a different serving temperature would have allowed the taste of apricot to kick in.

We’d enjoyed Noma Kyoto and had this crazy idea of jumping over to Denmark during a UK vacation if we secured seats. And we did. The location, approach, creativity, flavours and atmosphere are quite unlike anything we have experienced. The lunch service was in a different class. Everything was remarkable. The simplest things like the flower soup or finely chopped salad unlocks flavours you didn’t know existed. All the senses are entertained. Even texture brought to you in some dishes by surprising ingredients (including crispy fried and well hidden ants). From first sip of cider to last bite of chocolate covered magnolia flower and then tour of the kitchens and lab was well over 4 hours. Just a lovely memorable day.

We started with the Green Gazpacho canape. It was so fresh and refreshing after an afternoon of touring. My husband had the stuffed courgette flower and I had turbot. We often feel a restaurant can be judged by their vegetarian selections as many times they can be mundane. This one did not disappoint. The mixture of flavours was amazing!  My turbot was also a treat, with a selection of vegetables and a creamy wine sauce that set it off perfectly.
After looking at their extensive wine list, we were a bit overwhelmed and so asked for wine selections to be made for us and paired with our meals. They were perfect. I'm afraid we were so replete after dinner there was no room for dessert, but they were happy for us to sit and relax over the last of our wine and enjoy the cool evening air wafting in from the windows.

Overall, of what we did order was delectable. Canard à la presse was a true delight to find, as the contraptions to make and prepare this dish are difficult to come by. Not many restaurants in the world have access to one (Operakalleran in Stockholm is the next closest with the contraption). The excess duck goes to making some really great tasting appetisers, like the heart and liver tartlet. The juicy pink duck breast itself cames second to this. Exceptional!

The Danish black lobster was absolutely delicious, and was paired with the wonderful creamy bilecart-salmon brut.

The venue was minimalistic but sleek and refined. A modern classy atmosphere, I thoroughly, and surprisingly, enjoyed nearly everything here immensely.

But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.

Equipment is broken for weeks (sometimes months) at a time. Showers work intermittently, and when down, also take weeks to fix.

Locker room has lots of almost all half size lockers (many of which are broken) and these are only half occupied even at peak times. So why not install a room of full length lockers and keep them in working order? That would cost money. Can't do that it would seem.

There was a steam room. It was closed in early 2022, supposedly due to high energy prices at the time. Never reopened. No reason given, other then the ridiculous argument that somehow, by keeping it open, the whole business would fail and the gym would then have to close down.

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded.","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:59PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM'}",05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 11:59PM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM

The bakery itself is more focused on sweets. Their pumpkin buns were really good. Their croissat was not as good as BUKA. I would recommend more on their sweeets. Their poppy seeded danish with the sweet jam was also very good.

Tasty roast beef sandwich with yummy chutney, more on the sweet side.

The bakery shop had a small line of 6 people and both local community and tourists would come to the bakery. As I was standing in line, I could see flies and insects on the food as it was sitting on the lower wooden shelves. The pastries were not in any enclosed glass case. That alone deterred me from going in but I ordered a few pastries away from the lower shelves.
This is why I gave it a 3 star. Sanitary and cleanliness is a must for me.  I ordered a few danish pastries - chocolate croissant, custard danish, focaccia caprese sandwich, raspberry pastry and almond pastry - all were delicious. Dough was soft & fresh.

SHC personnels are professional. The trainers care about you and all members during the class, explain every movement, and give feedback at that moment. There is no language barrier, we communicate in English. Changing rooms are clean. They pay attention to the hygiene of the environment and the commonly used equipment.
I recommend SHC Scandinavia for those who are looking for a different option. Before the membership go and visit them. They will answer all of your questions :)",{'Wednesday': '12:00AM - 11:59PM'},,,12:00AM - 11:59PM,,,,

Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

If you dont speak Danish, it is probable to get overcharged by mistake because some of the staff are not well-trained with the system besides having language barrier. I paid fee for extra months while my membership was supposedly on pause. They sent me bills without even sending me a notification about reactivation beforehand. At the end of the complicated way through the customer service, the result was: ""I understand you but sorry we cant do anything, you have to pay the money"". Yeah, this is sad to pay fee for months when you could have attended the gym but you were unaware.
That was by far my poorest experience of customer service in Denmark.","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:59PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 12:00AM'}",05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 11:59PM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM,05:00AM - 12:00AM

I chose this gym because it was the cheapest from the town. Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.
When I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership. The staff is hardly speaking English.
I strongly recommend to avoid this gym.","{'Monday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Tuesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Wednesday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Thursday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Friday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Saturday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM', 'Sunday': '05:00AM - 11:00PM'}",05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM,05:00AM - 11:00PM

I am American, after all!) but they warmed up quick and we had a great convo over some beers.

The stained glass windows and smoke inside are like stepping into a time machine. Myself and my two companions propped up the bar one Monday night in March and had an excellent time. I worked my way through the bottles displayed on the top and enjoyed them all. The prices are very cheap. A three bottle round (good bottles) was never more than about £8.

We spoke for hours with the bartender and his knowledge of not only the city and booze were impressive, but just about anything. He knew much more than I did about Scottish whisky… and I’m a whisky loving Scot. Really great conversation throughout the night.

We got talking to some other visitors who came and went as the night went on as well. It’s that type of place.

The only shame is that we weren’t there longer for more than one visit. There’s a lot to see in the world and it’s unlikely I’ll be back to Copenhagen too quickly, despite loving it, but the Eiffel Bar is definitely a strong pull back…","{'Monday': '12:00PM - 02:00AM', 'Tuesday': '12:00PM - 11:59PM', 'Wednesday': '12:00PM - 02:00AM', 'Thursday': '12:00PM - 02:00AM', 'Friday': '12:00PM - 02:00AM', 'Saturday': '12:00PM - 02:00AM', 'Sunday': '12:00PM - 02:00AM'}",12:00PM - 02:00AM,12:00PM - 11:59PM,12:00PM - 02:00AM,12:00PM - 02:00AM,12:00PM - 02:00AM,12:00PM - 02:00AM,12:00PM - 02:00AM

The first time I visited, it was on an early Thursday evening, it was perfect — chill vibes, super friendly service, with good music playing on the background. My friend and I had a great time.

My next visit was on a late Friday night — loud, chaotic, and service was not that great. We had to sit at a table with broken glass. The bartenders (a guy and a girl) on the upper level deliberately ignored us while we were patiently waiting to be served. I understand that they must be pretty busy, but it wouldn’t hurt to acknowledge us with a small smile for us to wait. The cocktails were still pretty dope though.

While I really prefer Herlev Bymidte, I have to downgrade the review because they use something that jams your signal and forces you to use their own WiFi, which is not really safe. The other reason that it's awful is you lose all communication with people you are shopping with, which has caused massive meltdown with my autistic daughter who normally feels safe exploring as long as she knows she's able to reach me by phone or messenger. Today she couldn't. Her fear is heartbreaking and I'm afraid I can't shop here anymore unless I'm alone.

It is a bit small but very modern and fairly clean. At least more than other gyms I have seen in Copenhagen. It is often packed when it comes to using the barbell stations but definitely, I have seen it worse.

The staff is usually nice, although when you have a question (e.g. about billing etc.) it is all managed in a very confusing way. I do not think is their fault, but rather something related to their internal procedures and IT systems.

The classes are in Danish, but you can also find classes in English. Besides the language barriers, I find the classes useful and entertaining. Usually, the instructors are of a good level and there is quite a good variety.

The app is a welcome help for booking classes and other functions, although sometimes the user experience could be improved (and the same with the website).

I am still a client and I think the gym has the potential though to become even better.

They have everything you need including 6 squat racks / power cages and a bunch of free weight stuff, cardio machines. The only thing lacking is team workout.

Despite leaving the country and clearly cancelling my membership, this gym continued to charge me a recurring fee, month after month. I was shocked and frustrated to see this charge appearing on my credit card statement, especially as I was no longer in the country and had no access to their facilities.

The customer service provided by this gym was equally disappointing. I tried reaching out to them multiple times, via email, to rectify this issue but my requests were ignored or brushed off. It took a significant amount of time and effort on my part but they had no interest in resolving the issue.

In my opinion, this gym is clearly more concerned about lining their pockets rather than providing a quality service to their customers. Their lack of attention to customer service and unethical billing practices is unacceptable and I would not recommend this gym to anyone.
