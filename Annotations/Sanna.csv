9,There are some fantastic great instructors who inspire and help create a positive atmosphere. You always feel welcome on the different teams.

There has been really bad air for a month now, and it is simply too bad for a fitness centre. The air quality means quite a lot when you stand on treadmills. There is a need for a quick solution, because it is really hard to take off to work out in the indoor climate.Edited after answers:Center management, employees and puregym have already been contacted several times during October. Lots of excuses, or we send it forward without result. So I am not more optimistic when the answer here is enough we send it further.",Sanna

I could understand on the manager who was working today (26/10/23 at 13.30) that the head office has decided to banish me for 2 years for threats which is the lie. Furthermore, the manager said that there is no sound on the surveillance but that I have threatened one of the members The right version is that I was pushed and threatened by a member who is clearly on steroids in PureGym. He was pushing me away and threatened me violently. The police came and questioned us both. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and did not want to look at the monitoring and assessed that he was not allowed to use both machines at the same time. But according to this manager's the head office will want to make a decision anyway.

There are two women in the bike room who have really loud music, I go in and nicely ask if they won't turn down, where one of them breaks out that it's only for an hour and that they should be allowed to be here, I explain that the same thing applies to me and she just keeps repeating itself, so I just go out again. Later I get an email with a warning because of my inappropriate advice and then find out that one of the two women was a director. I don't get the opportunity to defend myself and tell my side and try to send a complaint to the member service, but also gets rejected and get a short answer to keep the warning. It's pure principle for me and it's so unfair, I've been a member for 10 years + and always behaved properly. To be treated like this after all ",all

However, there are some things that could be improved, including faster repair times of defective machines. 2-3 weeks is not all right, but unfortunately often a reality. Besides, you rarely see receptionists more, as these have apparently been given other tasks such as cleaning and cleaning up. I have also seen people go straight into my regular centre several times, without checking in, so unfortunately I also suspect cheating due to the often lack of reception staff. On the wish list is a SATS center in Hillerød:-) Otherwise I am perfectly satisfied with the 2 centres (BLOX and ABC) which I use primarily",all

108,"After being a customer of SATS and always paying my bills (for overpriced) for 7 years, I changed my cell phone last month after I was hired by a new company. This meant that my bill was not paid on time - my mistake 100%. However, the next thing that happened was that SATS sent me directly to Indrum - an debt collection company of the worst drawer. Super disappointed with the treatment by SATS. On the other hand, really well to be made aware of how I can spend 400kr more every month than at a miserable company:-)",Sanna
110,"It seems that SATS only focuses on the large centres, for example in inner Copenhagen. I train among others in Vallensbæk. I have trained on the team with functional training for more than 5 years - the director is great. Now the team is closed with the reason that there are not enough participants on the team. No, there are no waiting lists on the team, debt offers quality and social cohesion. That's exactly what the smaller centres can offer, but it's obviously not a factor in SATS unfortunately.",all
111,"Super center with always cute employees and a perfectly perfect center manager who always takes the time to talk.There's everything you need for your training.One minus is that SATS has decided not to have signs up referring to people not having to sit and talk on the phone,it's super disturbing for all of us who don't work out with music in their ears...",Sanna

In addition, I have a roommate who uses the center considerably more often, who has the same experience) There is a lack of general management of the center, otherwise it wouldn't be so bad... There is a lack of consistent hand alcohol in half of dispensations. - All toilets are grossly disgusting. It looks like no toilets are checked more than 2-3 times a day, which is absurd when you think of the amount of people who use the center daily. Staff should go a round every hour in peak hours, but move rarely from the counter, even when there are more at work. In addition, the toilets smell like a lack of basic cleaning (other than emptying the trash can and cleaning mirror) - no water vending machines, which means that you are forced into disgusting toilets to fill your small water bottle. - Several cabinets in the men's dressing room do not work, which means that it can be difficult to find a closet in any way.",all

139,"Keeping an eye on your bills - SATS likes to add extra payments without informing you about it.Your systems are in such a poor condition that they remove campaign benefits. In my case, it gave an extra bill on a month's subscription. Furthermore, they provide in the centers a wrong guide when it comes to setting up payment methods. If you sign up after 14th of the month, you must add payment methods to the center so that they can use the chosen method for the coming month. I was told in the center that I should just have done it before the next 14.Your payment department by phone is fairly cold and indifferent to their centers providing incorrect information upon registration. As well as that their systems impose extra payment without it being written anywhere.All in all this is not a business that I personally would trust.

equipment :
there is a lot of different equipment to choose from and it mainly consists of technogym plateloaded and machines as well as cable towers and there is a good mix of new and old, which appeals to me as I am a fan and often like the old equipment best. There is a sea of ​​grips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row 🤫

Atmosphere/premises:
The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! 🥰

Service:
The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat 🫠they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odense😉",all
251,"This gym offers all items, equipment and facilities that you would need. There are two big weightlifting areas (including barbells, dumbbells and machines), a big cardio area (treadmills, crosstrainer, stepper, cycles, ...), an area with the usual workout machines, a TRX area and in the one weightlifting area you have some open space to do your own workout (there are spinning ropes, medicine balls, kettleballs, asults, ringes, etc.). Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat). And I really like the 'freestyle' courses like Crossfit and Functional, because they include different equipments and are usually with only a few people so the trainer can focus on you. Everything is very clean, including the shower facilities. There is also a sauna and a steam bath. The ladies changing room comes with big mirrors, hair dryers and hair straightener. It's usually not to crowded and in my opinion super cheap (99 DKK for students).",all

morning",Sanna
358,"Wasted potential. This could be a good gym, but their obvious desire to minimize spending really hurts the customer experience.

Equipment is broken for weeks (sometimes months) at a time. Showers work intermittently, and when down, also take weeks to fix.

Locker room has lots of almost all half size lockers (many of which are broken) and these are only half occupied even at peak times. So why not install a room of full length lockers and keep them in working order? That would cost money. Can't do that it would seem.

There was a steam room. It was closed in early 2022, supposedly due to high energy prices at the time. Never reopened. No reason given, other then the ridiculous argument that somehow, by keeping it open, the whole business would fail and the gym would then have to close down.

And the minimal staffing means there's nobody to enforce the rules (CLEAN THE MACHINE WHEN YOU ARE DONE!) or do little things like fill up soap dispensers in the bathrooms and showers.",Sanna
364,"The gym is ok, although with rising prices I guess it became a bit expensive for what it offers. It is a bit small but very modern and fairly clean. At least more than other gyms I have seen in Copenhagen. It is often packed when it comes to using the barbell stations but definitely, I have seen it worse.

The staff is usually nice, although when you have a question (e.g. about billing etc.) it is all managed in a very confusing way. I do not think is their fault, but rather something related to their internal procedures and IT systems.

The classes are in Danish, but you can also find classes in English. Besides the language barriers, I find the classes useful and entertaining. Usually, the instructors are of a good level and there is quite a good variety.

The app is a welcome help for booking classes and other functions, although sometimes the user experience could be improved (and the same with the website).

I am still a client and I think the gym has the potential though to become even better. It depends on what the management will make out of it.",Sanna

It's CROWDED and the layout is terrible, there is just 1 machine for some basic exercises so you will always be waiting (just 1 machine for leg press, leg extension, chest flies, etc..). Other than that, the gym is old and in need of renovating. To make it even worse, the customer service in the call center or email is rude and won't listen to anything you might have to say. Avoid.",Sanna
393,"Medium size gym with aerobics classes. Instructors and staff are professional and friendly. Amazing view over the water from 1. floor. Parking can at times be challenging and a bit hazardous, as the beach road is quite narrow with a lot of traffic, so be careful when exiting or entering car!",all
397,"The legend has it that the Sauna used to function once… it’s been out of order for months now. Escalators always out of order... 4 soap dispenser in men’s shower, always empty. So far worst Sats I’ve been to.",all
398,"While it is spacious and with the ability to brag about a wide variety of equipment, the standard of several machines, is low. Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.

While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)
The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.

All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.",all
404,"A few stars for a nice location, however the place itself is dirty, machines are old / out of order, it’s lacking equipment and floor spacing (they rather want to sell clothes than utilize space for actual fitness equipment for us to work with). Cannot recommend",Sanna
405,"Underwhelming. SATS has the reputation of being a bit of an upper-class gym according to the pricing compared to other gyms, but in reality it’s filthy. Mold, dirt, outdated equipment…. The workout areas are not thought of to make them comfortable.",Sanna
406,"Messy, unorganized and strange gym culture. Very urban.",all
407,"Alright so the staff don't know the rules. First they say I can pause for 6 months with no problems, then it's 4 months and it costs 150 per month. It costs you to stop the membership and it will cost you to start it again.im paying +300dkk per month, for that price, I'm expecting much better service than this. Every time I want to do something the system is down. SATS will change your rules if you haven't been with fitness Dk for Long. The gym is big, and NO ONE re racks their weights. If I wouldn't have this gym at 100m I wouldn't honestly come back and I've been going to different gyms to +10 years",Sanna
409,Mohamad was a great help and went above and beyond. The customer service is top notch and I would recommend Sats to everyone!,all
412,"I don’t usually write reviews but this is by far the worst gym I have tried in my life. Equipments are old, staff is not friendly/welcoming, minimal classes outside work hours (who’s going to them?!?), no warning that cycling classes need your own shoes (what a waste of time turning up) and I was told there will be English classes (no one spoke English). Save yourself the hassle and join another gym or are all gyms this terrible in cph?",all
413,Horrible internet connection. Staff knows about it and it brings frequent complaints but the management won’t do anything about it.,Sanna
414,"Perfect geographical location. Unfortunately, equipement is so mid and kinda rusty in some cases. No problem with the staff tho. But accessoire wise, there's a lot of room for improvement.",Sanna
416,"The star is only for friendly staff.
The gym itself is a mess, and looks like no one is keeping it clean.
Sauna not working. Showers are under renovation but they didn’t install emergency showers either. Not even to mention the changing area 🤢 with old fashioned method of lockers.",all
418,"The men’s showers are better now, but still room for improvement",Sanna
421,"The gym itself is massive with a lot of different equipment and facilities. However, the service which the SATS' staff provides is below satisfactory. I had issues with my membership and none of the clerks tried to help despite me asking. Still, I would recommend this gym as opposed to others.",Sanna
422,Ok,Sanna
423,"I have been coming here on and off for 5 years. And it gets worse every time I return!
The hygiene in the bath and sauna is under all criticism! Toilet paper, bottles and water on the floor! This is not an isolated case! There needs to be a stronger member policy in the house and more cleaning

Training facilities etc are good",all
425,"Best place to train in kbh, free parking, and really nice helpful staff",all
427,"Very nice quite large fitness center. Plenty of equipment. Almost always vacant treadmills, bikes and cross trainers. Large spinning studio and two other studios for classes. Staff is very friendly, and people are in general nice. I have been a member the last ten years. There are no xxx heavy dumbbells which keeps away the pro body builder type. You can buy a quite large assortment of fitness beverages energy bars and coffee in the cafe.",Sanna
430,"Partly reasonable gym in the morning and afternoon, but after that it goes downhill. The evening is terrible: shouting groups of young boys who mostly use Sats as a youth club. But the worst part is that it is filthy in the evening - especially the toilets and bathrooms. There is a lot of snuff and wool from socks in the bathroom that needs to be cleaned - and no one mops the floor (neither staff nor users). The sauna and steam bath (closed) are clammy after a whole day of sweat. People use their own rules regarding the sauna, e.g. having an unofficial party with music in the sauna, so that others cannot enter without stinking of peppermint. The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open). There is also a lot missing compared to previously under Fitnessdk, for example. free coffee. The quality is just decreasing and the clientele is going in the wrong direction: more suspicious types in the evening (and it's not the ones from Gentofte).

Bad gym!!!",all
431,"Flood in mens bath, sauna and steam bath often broken and maybe 8 out of 150 lockers actually work.. So you need to bring your stuff around the gym",Sanna
434,"After having been a member of Fitness World for 10 years, I chose to switch to rate and keep then a difference. Better machines, more dumbbells, and much more welcoming staff. It is clearly the best decision I made when I chose to switch to rate.",all
435,"It has now been difficult to find a cabinet that works for a long time. Today I drove home after trying 15 different lockers where the lock didn't work.
Are also tired of their own Corona rules not being followed.
So now I'm changing center.
Otherwise, I was happy to come there, so I hope they will soon get the various things under control so that I can come back.",all
439,fantastic service. nice equipment.,all
440,"Super delicious place with all imaginable training tools from turf, weights and general cardio to cross-country skiing. Lots of air and light and nice changing rooms. There is free parking.
Remember that you must use the padlock here and not the membership card for the lockers",all
442,Neat and clean place for workout.,Sanna
444,"The worst rate I have been in. Old and lousy fitness machines, small and bad layout... Find another center so last visit",Sanna
449,"Fantastic gym with tons of equipment. Plenty of options and plenty of space to move around. Lots of racks, benches, dumbbells, kettlebells, bands. Cardio equipment includes plenty of treadmills, bikes, stair climbers, etc.

Plenty of lockers available and I was offered a combo lock if needed. Affordable day pass (60 dkk) was easy to pay. There was always an employee at or near the front desk who was quick to help.",Sanna
451,"I’ve lived in San Francisco, Japan, Spain and now Copenhagen for a little bit, but this is by far the best gym I have ever been too for the cost. At this location, they have a live DJ from 4 to 8 PM on Monday evenings, and at the other location they have a live DJ at the same time on Tuesday evenings. It’s quite amazing for the price! It’s a nice thing to have as well to spice up the workout.

Plus, they have friendly staff, plenty of lockers to put away your stuff, a Zen room to do your own AI powered workout, and so many machines! Also, they have drinks and protein ice cream bars you can purchase.",all
490,"If you like to get Energy into your bloodstream, that’s the place to go. ☀️
The personnel is also very nice and helpful 👍",all
552,"Not as many good classes anymore. TRX and functional training classes are great for strength and cardio, but difficult to find a good class",Sanna
553,"Great gym! So many good offers for memberships and lots of machines and equipment. The only negative thing I would say is that nobody is brining towels to have with them, which has usually been a requirement at gyms I go to. Therefore if people don't use the paper towels to clean you sometimes find a machine that is really sweaty and dirty and you have to clean it yourself! I think it would be nice if they changed that and asked people to bring towels for hygienic reasons. But otherwise I love the gym and would recommend! Really friendly staff too!",Sanna
554,"Great place to do your workout. New and always good maintained equipment, and their team activities are always with good instructors. Like most of the other Fitness World centers it's really good.",Sanna
555,Very big space with lot of good machines in good state. Very friendly staff.,Sanna
556,"I like this center. Great location, great opening hours and a great size. It's not too big nor to small. I primarily attend the classes and find that they have great instructors. The locker rooms are nice and clean.",Sanna
557,"Nice fitness center, they have a lot of squat racks, free weights and cardio machines. They do lack some of the traditional machines.",Sanna
558,"It's fine for what it is, but half the lockers can't lock properly, and the machines are quite worn down.",Sanna
559,"One of the better fitness centers, at least in the ""Fitness World"" line-up",Sanna
560,Cluttered and strangely structured center. Disabled toilet and stretcher in the same room,Sanna
561,"I think I am gonna quit that GYM, the same playlist for 5 months.....It's make me crazy. No way the reason of quitting will be music.... Please change it",Sanna
562,"Great fitness studio with nice and helpfull staff. The only drawback is the very unflexible membership system. I'm working abroad every other month and there is no suitable membership plan for a situation like this. I'm required to pay 100 DKK everytime I want to pause my membership when starting work, which isnt very nice.",Sanna
563,Clean but have some old equipment that could be replaced,Sanna
564,Great fitness center with good classes. I've been very pleased with the friendliness and professionalism among their instructors and staff. It is a place you like to work out.,Sanna
565,"Great place, nice separation of floors, clean.",Sanna
566,"Bad vibes! Too many people, especially at this FW is starring at you if you actually do a good job and are serious about training. To fit in, you should stare at your phone and don’t pay attention to exercise at all.. 🫤 It’s a shame.. The culture makes me change to FitnessX !!",Sanna
567,"Clean gym with everything I need for general bodybuilding purposes. Although some equipment is visibly worn out and the gym may be crowded at times, it's not a reason to complain given the price and 05:00-24:00 opening times.",Sanna
568,"Really Cheap fitness chain. Nothing luxury. Nothing to make the experience better. Dated cardio machines. Everything feel old. No improvements in 10 years in technology applied to training or experience. Quite dirty, low maintenance. Dirty change rooms, not even soap in showers. Weird people hanging out but not training. Unfortunately they are like a monopoly, not other options in the city. Danes have high income but the gyms are really lame and basic compared to other countries.",Sanna
570,"Gym is decent, but there is no air-conditioning in the summer which makes it just unbearable. Also no WiFi and mediocre maintenance.",Sanna
572,Pretty bad compared to the other places fitness world centers I've been to in Aarhus,Sanna

580,Good place to relax and get fit,Sanna
581,"Great place, a lot of machines and heavy lifting space, big fitness room suitable for stretching or warming up session.",Sanna
582,"It is new facility and the equipment is worst. I have seen many not in working mode even after few days.

Treadmills are worse and not installed properly. They are very tiresome and I have said many times to the staff but no actions.

The staff is kind and good but no action towards the improvements we suggest.",Sanna
583,"Good local fitness center. Rush hours from 17 to 19, better go after or before these hours. Please, add new music videos.",Sanna
584,Just love it,Sanna
585,"Not the biggest Fitness World, you can safely say, there aren't many parking spaces. So you have to stop at Bilka if you come in prime time, i.e. around 16 to 18:00.

The place is open until 00:00 on weekdays, so that everyone can get a workout in. There isn't bikefit and all that cycling like in the really big centres.",all
586,"Amazing spacy gym with long opening hours, parking and modern machines.",Sanna
587,"Tge gym is fine, but people here do not put weigths on their place",Sanna
588,Do not recommend if you don't want to be boiled. It's too hot inside and no proper ventilation.,Sanna
589,"A good-sized gym on several floors, with a large variety of free weights, machines and classes. Not the tidiest Fitness World you'll find; weight plates often strewn around the area rather than stacked on a weights tree.",Sanna
591,"Members do not clean after themselves, do not put the weight back
The gym is messy and dirty. The floor is nasty. The weights are everywhere but on the racks. The bottom floor that is in the cellar is humid as hell. Equipments are not maintained and a lot of them are broken or have flaws. The rubber bands that are available for use are so dirty and sticky. The only reason I keep the membership is because it is literally 2 minutes from where I live. Do not recommend to anyone, not worth the money.",Sanna

Spacious.
However the Big group training area's floor is almost fully broken. Everywhere there you step on, you may twist your ankle. As time goes by, it gets worse.",Sanna

Benches are broken and probably at least 30 years old. They cannot fold due to broken mechanisms.
Towers are old and half broken.

Seriously one of the worst equipped gyms I have seen.",all
