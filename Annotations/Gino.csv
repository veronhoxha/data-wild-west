12,"We train in PureGym at Christianshavn. It is a nice centre with a high ceiling - many opportunities for versatile training and you feel comfortable among the other guests in the center. There is almost always room to train - there is clean and nice and there is a friendly staff. However, there is very little area in the center for extension and self-training.",all
13,"New dumbbells are nice. The center always has a good tone and a welcoming staff. The bathroom and men's changing can easily withstand a refreshment. Currently, the men's bath has been rebuilt - though I find it highly questionable that there is no progress in the renovation at all!!

30,"Unfortunately this morning I have had a rather bad experience of your customer service at Jens Baggesensvej in Aarhus. I work out in the morning and arrive at the center at 7 a.m., where I find out that I have unfortunately forgotten my card. No problem I think, because I know that there are always staff who clean up and fill up goods etc., who must be able to help poor me. A personal trainer is behind the box and accepts my message, and goes down to the staff who are doing the cleaning downstairs. Two minutes later he comes back and tells me that they can't help when they first serve customers from 8 a.m. so I could just wait an hour. I thought that was a terrible experience and I'm going to report out of the center because of it.",Gino

54,"I've been trying to work out in PureGym Vejlevej, Fredericia. My card has been jammed due to a situation that happened 3 days ago. I could understand on the manager who was working today (26/10/23 at 13.30) that the head office has decided to banish me for 2 years for threats which is the lie. Furthermore, the manager said that there is no sound on the surveillance but that I have threatened one of the members The right version is that I was pushed and threatened by a member who is clearly on steroids in PureGym. He was pushing me away and threatened me violently. The police came and questioned us both. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and did not want to look at the monitoring and assessed that he was not allowed to use both machines at the same time. But according to this manager's the head office will want to make a decision anyway. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and would not look at the monitoring and decided that there was no push on the threat or like. But the video.

There are two women in the bike room who have really loud music, I go in and nicely ask if they won't turn down, where one of them breaks out that it's only for an hour and that they should be allowed to be here, I explain that the same thing applies to me and she just keeps repeating itself, so I just go out again. Later I get an email with a warning because of my inappropriate advice and then find out that one of the two women was a director. I don't get the opportunity to defend myself and tell my side and try to send a complaint to the member service, but also gets rejected and get a short answer to keep the warning. It's pure principle for me and it's so unfair, I've been a member for 10 years + and always behaved properly. To be treated like this after all ",all

However, there are some things that could be improved, including faster repair times of defective machines. 2-3 weeks is not all right, but unfortunately often a reality. Besides, you rarely see receptionists more, as these have apparently been given other tasks such as cleaning and cleaning up. I have also seen people go straight into my regular centre several times, without checking in, so unfortunately I also suspect cheating due to the often lack of reception staff. On the wish list is a SATS center in Hillerød:-) Otherwise I am perfectly satisfied with the 2 centres (BLOX and ABC) which I use primarily",all

110,"It seems that SATS only focuses on the large centres, for example in inner Copenhagen. I train among others in Vallensbæk. I have trained on the team with functional training for more than 5 years - the director is great. Now the team is closed with the reason that there are not enough participants on the team. No, there are no waiting lists on the team, debt offers quality and social cohesion. That's exactly what the smaller centres can offer, but it's obviously not a factor in SATS unfortunately.",all

114,"Really delicious machines, good teams, cute employees, value for money, but there could be a need for some extra cleaning in the lady dress in general. Perhaps this is because most men are employed, which therefore does not access the dressing room just as much? But overall it is Nice",all

124,"In the period when I was at Sats, it wasn't always that sauna or the cold shower worked. The cables also broke often, and it took a long time before it was fixed. It was a period of austerity, and a hard economy, so that's what it is. However, it's still not optimal.What really suits me is that I could no longer train, so I would quit my subscription. Sats offer me 2 months of rest free. I accept that.I find out that I can no longer train, so I say the abonnoment up. It also means that the rest state is terminated, and that I have to pay from today's date of +1 month. Current plus a month is very normal, but that they don't clearly indicate that the rest state they had offered me will be terminated disappointing me much.I am 20 years and have always played sports. After I have finished marathon in the beginning of November, I will not report me into fitness again that the customer. I have been able to earn more.",Gino
128,"It's a shame that so fine service delivered yesterday and today to my wife and I - by Liv and Oliver in the *helsinore department, is technically complicated (computer) due to a problematic registration due to it's a campaign offer. You should be told that it takes about 20-25 minutes to sign up before you say ""yes thanks"" to the offer. Too bad that Dankort's machine doesn't funk when you try both with chip and wireless and you have to sign up through the iPad. Skranke service should be faster - but it's just not and it's a shame when you have such skilled and service minded staff. Thanks a lot to Life and Oliver and all the technical stuff can go somewhere. Therefore minus a star. The offer in itself is fine and I look forward very much to an hour with Christian who has been recommended by several from SATS.",Gino
129,"(The review is written after 8 visits to the center over period of two months. In addition, I have a roommate who uses the center considerably more often, who has the same experience) There is a lack of general management of the center, otherwise it wouldn't be so bad... There is a lack of consistent hand alcohol in half of dispensations. - All toilets are grossly disgusting. It looks like no toilets are checked more than 2-3 times a day, which is absurd when you think of the amount of people who use the center daily. Staff should go a round every hour in peak hours, but move rarely from the counter, even when there are more at work. In addition, the toilets smell like a lack of basic cleaning (other than emptying the trash can and cleaning mirror) - no water vending machines, which means that you are forced into disgusting toilets to fill your small water bottle. - Several cabinets in the men's dressing room do not work, which means that it can be difficult to find a closet in any way.",all
130,"I ask if the music can be turned down a bit when I work out at the center. Only in the evening when there are few guests left and almost everyone hears sound in their own headphones. Typically, the employee says of course and turns down a little. This evening I saw that they turned up higher instead of turning down - when I asked for the second time. At 9.15 p.m. and pretty much everyone heard their own sound. But there was a group of employees hanging out in the desk. (together with what emerged as a group of friends) All my family appreciates training in the center and we use our own personal trainers. But today I experienced a flabet and unengaged service (in particular from one of the employees) It was more important that the staff had a party than that they as a guest felt welcome.I wanted a handshake of the employee as a sort of regret.

139,"Keeping an eye on your bills - SATS likes to add extra payments without informing you about it.Your systems are in such a poor condition that they remove campaign benefits. In my case, it gave an extra bill on a month's subscription. Furthermore, they provide in the centers a wrong guide when it comes to setting up payment methods. If you sign up after 14th of the month, you must add payment methods to the center so that they can use the chosen method for the coming month. I was told in the center that I should just have done it before the next 14.Your payment department by phone is fairly cold and indifferent to their centers providing incorrect information upon registration. As well as that their systems impose extra payment without it being written anywhere.All in all this is not a business that I personally would trust.

As a minus I think that many of the centers are now in need of a thorough renovation/upgrade. There's no ""luxus"" over SATS longer than other centers. Changing the two centers where I work out is very worn out, the showers are bad. And the machines are very long to be made when they break - a ""technician is called"" sign can sit long time on a machine before the error is corrected.... When I still give 4 stars it's because SATS is just a nice place to come, and there's always a really good mood no matter which center I train in. So once again, great praise to the staff....",Gino

249,"Bondovej gym has been my regular and favorite gym for the last 2 years. Primarily because, in my opinion, it is the best pure gym center in this part of Odense🙃

equipment :
there is a lot of different equipment to choose from and it mainly consists of technogym plateloaded and machines as well as cable towers and there is a good mix of new and old, which appeals to me as I am a fan and often like the old equipment best. There is a sea of ​​grips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row 🤫

Atmosphere/premises:
The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! 🥰

Service:
The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat 🫠they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odense😉",all
251,"This gym offers all items, equipment and facilities that you would need. There are two big weightlifting areas (including barbells, dumbbells and machines), a big cardio area (treadmills, crosstrainer, stepper, cycles, ...), an area with the usual workout machines, a TRX area and in the one weightlifting area you have some open space to do your own workout (there are spinning ropes, medicine balls, kettleballs, asults, ringes, etc.). Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat). And I really like the 'freestyle' courses like Crossfit and Functional, because they include different equipments and are usually with only a few people so the trainer can focus on you. Everything is very clean, including the shower facilities. There is also a sauna and a steam bath. The ladies changing room comes with big mirrors, hair dryers and hair straightener. It's usually not to crowded and in my opinion super cheap (99 DKK for students).",all

289,Had my membership cancelled in the counter in proper time but still had to pay additional month.,Gino
290,"One can talk about broken machines or dirt in the changing rooms, but I realize that things can't be ideal all the time. So I'd say it all goes relatively well until one needs to talk to someone beyond the helping guys in the centre. The company doesn't have a phone number to call. They have a chat, which main purpose seems to relay a message ""Fill in the online contact form"". When you do, there is a waiting time from hours to days. And if you get an answer, it never changes regardless whether you can prove them wrong or lying. They merely stop responding. And there's nothing you can say to someone who is not willing to listen.",Gino
291,"Is the busiest fitness world what i ever seen before . It’s absolutely desastre. I cannot workout normally… today i make for 1h - just 3 exercises. I recommend to nobody subscribe there . They don’t care about the occupancy… (may be we need new covid pandemy) sale and sale new memberships. Also they grow up with the price ? For what? Unfortunately I’m looking for other place with a months; just here is noone option. I hope other companies make good the marketing. Repeat: not subscribe in this gym you will sorry a lot 😪 doesn’t matter the day; weekends ; evenings or mornings all the time is full full full , no one place free to work ! You pay your money for nothing!",Gino
293,"Really like this gym,  I just think it gets a bit dirty. They vacuum every day but that seems to be it.  A lot of equipment and different types: machines,  free weights, kettle bells, balls etc... and great space too",Gino
294,"They should put more space to park the bikes, it is very busy in the afternoon and I didn't like that they made me take off my shoes when that rule is not written anywhere",Gino
296,"Ok gym for a chain. Slection of machines is good, slection of classes not so good. Not crowded. Highlight is the two squash terrains. Downside - you cant reserve them online if you're not a squash member. Fitness membership doesnt help, you have to have a seperate squash membership.",Gino
300,"Great place to work out, the Dance Fit class was really good.  But as with all FW centers a good cleaning, would be great!",Gino
301,"I was told one thing in English, then made sign something else in Danish, so they could charge me for time I wasn't even in Denmark",Gino
302,"Pretty much every type of training equipment you find yourself needing. It is open 24/7 and has a nice system for entering and exiting. The place is clean and neat, and the atmoshpere is relaxed. A special plus about this center is the high ceilings making the air circulation very nice. Staff is always smiling and friendly, never felt that it was overcrowded with visitors, even at peak hours.",Gino
303,"One of the best places to train in Denmark. Many locations specially in Copenhagen, with good equipment.",Gino
304,"These 5 stars are for the hardworking staff who make this gym shine. If by some chance they have been laid off or furloughed due to the pandemic, please hire them all again.",Gino

370,"They raise membership prices without any warning, they closes the sauna without any explanations or due date, it takes them weeks to fix broken machines, and the changing room are usually disgusting at all times. No need to mention it is overly expensive, and that they don’t offer membership options (the only one being Mon-Fri until 3pm VS anytime, for 40kr difference). Furthermore, they brand it as Spa when there is only one small sauna which just reopened after several weeks, and is now missing features such as time and sensor. Unacceptable.",all
375,"Recently upgraded with new machines on top floor & Additional weights.
Kept decently clean, usually not too busy, sauna, large stretch/mobility area. Great staff.

The downstairs is where it's at. Racks on racks on racks all with full platforms. + A grass area for sleds and more.",all
377,"Great staff! Helpful and friendly!
But the center itself feels rusty and old compared to SATS on nørrebro.",Gino
382,"Unfortunately the gym is quite filthy all around. You cannot go and stretch on the mats without seeing the whole floor and the mat covered with little flakes (skin, dandruff...) and the smell of sweat. The dressing rooms are not any better. Generally, there should be cleaning happening at least 2-3 times a day. Now I already spoke with the employees and they said that they are doing it themselves and they only do it in the morning. That is a shame that the floor workers are taking care of the cleaning when there should be professionals doing it. This is not good enough. Additionally, the gym equipment and dumbbells are left lying around after use, so you cannot tell whether people are still using them. Not worth the money.",all
384,"The workers from the reception they don't even move... the service its so so bad... They don't have any qualification, the guy who gave me the subscription he didn't know how much I would payed and he lied to me.. he told me one month free, and I didn't get any month for free.. its was scam. Horrible service.",all
387,"For the money you pay the quality of the gym is very low.
- very dirty, everything is sticky
- for some reasons there are like hundreds of cardio machines and limited of lifting machines
- machines placed in a completely random order
- lack of weight plates and no order for these either
- showers slippery one needs to have Spider-Man abilities to walk there
- showers and sauna very dirty
- ok friendly staff",all
389,"Dirty, a lot of the equipment is broken. Basically only 3 toilets working at least for men. toilets are always very dirty.",Gino
390,"+ Big, nice view from some parts
+ Two nice saunas

- Small locker room, pretty dark. The lockers are tricky sometimes
- Crowded. No space because they have put equipment and machines in every corner of this gym?",all
391,"Small but cozy gym. Always very clean, well maintained and in order. The space is very open, doesn't feel suffocating. The equipment feels new. The atmosphere is great — people are respectful and welcoming and the employees are warm and friendly. It's not the biggest gym but has everything you need for weightlifting!",all
393,"Medium size gym with aerobics classes. Instructors and staff are professional and friendly. Amazing view over the water from 1. floor. Parking can at times be challenging and a bit hazardous, as the beach road is quite narrow with a lot of traffic, so be careful when exiting or entering car!",all
395,Excellent facilities with view to the ocean!,Gino
397,"The legend has it that the Sauna used to function once… it’s been out of order for months now. Escalators always out of order... 4 soap dispenser in men’s shower, always empty. So far worst Sats I’ve been to.",all
398,"While it is spacious and with the ability to brag about a wide variety of equipment, the standard of several machines, is low. Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.

While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)
The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.

All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.",all
399,Okay but it lacks mirrors (TRX area) and air circulation. An upgrade of the machines would also be helpful.,Gino
400,"The dirtiest gym that I have ever been to. Been here multiple times since it’s the closest one, but both the smell and mess is outrageous.",Gino
401,"They simply dont clean this place enough. It needs an extremely thorough cleaning and much much more regular cleaning.  I will omit the pictures from the showers.  Seriously, especially in the age of hygiene!",Gino
403,"General vibe bad. Situation seems like: ""We know we're not going to renew this lease, so let's put in the minimum effort and money and keep the place open."" They really should clean the equipment better, and more frequently, than they do.

You've only got about a 75% chance that the steam room is working in the men's lockers (and this was before they made up the lame excuse of energy cost). It often breaks, and stays broken for long periods of time, and has been closed for over a year and a half as of summer of 2023. No idea why they can't keep this running. There was also a missing plank in the sauna bench that took over 6 months to fix. So, maintenance is pretty bad all around.

Note that sometimes they do classes out on the gym floor on the second level. So you're somewhat constrained when that happens, and you best like the music they are playing or you'll want to be on the ground floor instead.",Gino
406,"Messy, unorganized and strange gym culture. Very urban.",all
409,Mohamad was a great help and went above and beyond. The customer service is top notch and I would recommend Sats to everyone!,all
411,"The locker rooms and bath facilities are in terrible condition. Rusty, dirty, and simply worn-out and broken. Also, the young people at the front desk are either not there or are sitting in the lounge area looking at their mobile phones. At least they could swipe the floor.",Gino
412,"I don’t usually write reviews but this is by far the worst gym I have tried in my life. Equipments are old, staff is not friendly/welcoming, minimal classes outside work hours (who’s going to them?!?), no warning that cycling classes need your own shoes (what a waste of time turning up) and I was told there will be English classes (no one spoke English). Save yourself the hassle and join another gym or are all gyms this terrible in cph?",all
416,"The star is only for friendly staff.
The gym itself is a mess, and looks like no one is keeping it clean.
Sauna not working. Showers are under renovation but they didn’t install emergency showers either. Not even to mention the changing area 🤢 with old fashioned method of lockers.",all
419,"small basement gym, alot of old equipment, alot of broken machines, not ok, compare to the price for membership",Gino
423,"I have been coming here on and off for 5 years. And it gets worse every time I return!
The hygiene in the bath and sauna is under all criticism! Toilet paper, bottles and water on the floor! This is not an isolated case! There needs to be a stronger member policy in the house and more cleaning

Training facilities etc are good",all
425,"Best place to train in kbh, free parking, and really nice helpful staff",all
426,"Been member now for three years. Staff are great and very clean place. Good equipment and for many pieces, been changed in the last few months. Like all gyms gets busy in the rush hour times but not full of a load of tattoo knuckleheads. Nice place and a nice relaxed vibe.",Gino
428,"Makes it impossible to cancel membership, and keeps asking for money after with made-up bills.",Gino
430,"Partly reasonable gym in the morning and afternoon, but after that it goes downhill. The evening is terrible: shouting groups of young boys who mostly use Sats as a youth club. But the worst part is that it is filthy in the evening - especially the toilets and bathrooms. There is a lot of snuff and wool from socks in the bathroom that needs to be cleaned - and no one mops the floor (neither staff nor users). The sauna and steam bath (closed) are clammy after a whole day of sweat. People use their own rules regarding the sauna, e.g. having an unofficial party with music in the sauna, so that others cannot enter without stinking of peppermint. The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open). There is also a lot missing compared to previously under Fitnessdk, for example. free coffee. The quality is just decreasing and the clientele is going in the wrong direction: more suspicious types in the evening (and it's not the ones from Gentofte).

Bad gym!!!",all
433,"Nice center with brand new, beautiful bathing facilities. There is both a steam bath, a sauna and plenty of space.
The exercise machines are not all the latest and that drags you down. There are plenty of opportunities to look out over Herlev town center and I like the air it gives to a training center that there are windows with a view.
There is also a bit of CrossFit.",Gino

Are also tired of their own Corona rules not being followed.
So now I'm changing center.
Otherwise, I was happy to come there, so I hope they will soon get the various things under control so that I can come back.",all

448,"Good location, reasonably good price for Danish standards, open 7 days a week, and super friendly staff by email and at the entrance.
Equipment not extremely new but very well kept, good space and when you join, they also offer a free coaching/personal session to guide you! 💪",Gino
451,"I’ve lived in San Francisco, Japan, Spain and now Copenhagen for a little bit, but this is by far the best gym I have ever been too for the cost. At this location, they have a live DJ from 4 to 8 PM on Monday evenings, and at the other location they have a live DJ at the same time on Tuesday evenings. It’s quite amazing for the price! It’s a nice thing to have as well to spice up the workout.

Plus, they have friendly staff, plenty of lockers to put away your stuff, a Zen room to do your own AI powered workout, and so many machines! Also, they have drinks and protein ice cream bars you can purchase.",all

453,"Go here at night and it is like getting into a night club, great atmosphere and music is almost always on point!
There is a guy here, think he is called Rasmus, always smiling and welcoming. He gets you in a mood that forces all great energy into you and makes the lifts much better. Would highly recommend going here, and in Repeat I general!",Gino
454,"Love the interior of this gym. Much better than any other gym I have tried. They have a great selection of equipment. However, the music is sometimes really really loud and the place can get quite busy during peek hours.",Gino
455,"This gym has really terrible policies for drop in, day pass people, such as tourists like myself. I went there at 3:15pm on a Saturday, and the staff member told me I couldn't train because he was leaving at 4pm, and I was not allowed to let myself out of the gym without a staff member being there, even though it's a 24 hour gym and was full of people. Very bad policy for taking care of casual people like me who really want to train.",Gino
456,"Great gym and CrossFit lessons, I usually do drop in when I visit CPH. If you do not speak Dannish and are looking to do a drop in CrossFit avoid classes with the coach John David, he has a lack of interest and not welcoming to new members, the rest of the coaches are great.
I totally recommend this friendly gym.",Gino
