Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.\n\nWhile the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines\/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)\nThe mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.\n\nAll in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now.

The evening is terrible: shouting groups of young boys who mostly use Sats as a youth club. But the worst part is that it is filthy in the evening - especially the toilets and bathrooms. There is a lot of snuff and wool from socks in the bathroom that needs to be cleaned - and no one mops the floor (neither staff nor users). The sauna and steam bath (closed) are clammy after a whole day of sweat. People use their own rules regarding the sauna, e.g. having an unofficial party with music in the sauna, so that others cannot enter without stinking of peppermint. The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open). There is also a lot missing compared to previously under Fitnessdk, for example. free coffee.
