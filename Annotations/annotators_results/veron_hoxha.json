It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.\n\nMoreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded.","annotator":"Veron"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-11-04T12:18:16.372631Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T13:44:47.019014Z","inner_id":120,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":848,"annotations":[{"id":345,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"taxonomy":[["Positive"],["Positive","Staff"]]},"id":"b-rIzBe55d","from_name":"taxonomy","to_name":"text","type":"taxonomy","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-04T13:44:55.974316Z","updated_at":"2023-11-04T13:44:55.974316Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-04T13:44:54.666128Z","lead_time":8.106,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"6045c070-67c6-4be1-b64b-78edbfeb3d58","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":848,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"0fe50f89-Veron.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"ID":264,"text":"Huge training space.

Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.\n\nWhile the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines\/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)\nThe mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.\n\nAll in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now.

There is a lot of snuff and wool from socks in the bathroom that needs to be cleaned - and no one mops the floor (neither staff nor users). The sauna and steam bath (closed) are clammy after a whole day of sweat. People use their own rules regarding the sauna, e.g. having an unofficial party with music in the sauna, so that others cannot enter without stinking of peppermint. The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open).
