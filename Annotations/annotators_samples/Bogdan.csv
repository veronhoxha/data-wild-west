6,"I exercise early in the morning and start before staff arrives. A fine arrangement that can be done. Now, however, I have experienced my card twice in the past while having been rejected by a technique error that I cannot get an explanation for. I have had the card checked and it is not a problem. I have to wait for the neighborhood to go before you can use the card again. Here I have come in, but it is annoying. The first time this happened I had my membership card exchanged, but the same mistake repeated with the new one.",Bogdan
7,"there is a nice atmosphere in the morning there is what it takes to get a good training, many have trained together for several years, there are few things that could get better, we train 3 times a week on Bondovej in odense",Bogdan
8,"I trained 4-6 times a week for several years, as there is always a center nearby - super easy - so there is no excuse not to squeeze a quick workout into a busy everyday life, and still stick to a healthy and active lifestyle.Generally a friendly staff, wide selection of machines, as well as fun and efficient teams ",all
12,"We train in PureGym at Christianshavn. It is a nice centre with a high ceiling - many opportunities for versatile training and you feel comfortable among the other guests in the center. There is almost always room to train - there is clean and nice and there is a friendly staff. However, there is very little area in the center for extension and self-training.",all
13,"New dumbbells are nice. The center always has a good tone and a welcoming staff. The bathroom and men's changing can easily withstand a refreshment. Currently, the men's bath has been rebuilt - though I find it highly questionable that there is no progress in the renovation at all!! The bath has been closed since the 20th and there is just scratched in a hole in the floor.",all
15,"Great to get going! Sometimes it can be difficult with the motivation, but then it's good to have a training taster who can keep you going.",all
16,Got the worst treatment in Hobro after center manager has changed in my membership. My card didn't work that goes 14 days but fatigue text from center manager and staff before the card works again..the center is dirty and several machines are broken. Can't recommend the Hobro center. But Gug is super fine.,all
17,My end at V Bro Kh is well designed and staff are welcoming. Good advice for the chain: Rate much more on +50 year old customers. One study after another document that strength training is the main pillar to maintain a moving and healthy body.The rate could be open offers at special quiet times.,Bogdan
19,"It is a good place to train, here comes people of all age groups - the service is top and the same goes for machines, weights etc. and fine cleaning has been done.",all
20,"floors in the men's bathrooms are smooth so you have to walk very carefully, so some of the machines intrude when they break up all the time",all
21,I started my membership in October and halfway into the month I choose to quit my membership because I quit school in early November but then I see that I wasn't out of business so I had to pay for November but then I quit today (1/11) also I see that my membership doesn't stop until 31/12 so I have to pay for 2 months I can't train,Bogdan

54,"I've been trying to work out in PureGym Vejlevej, Fredericia. My card has been jammed due to a situation that happened 3 days ago. I could understand on the manager who was working today (26/10/23 at 13.30) that the head office has decided to banish me for 2 years for threats which is the lie. Furthermore, the manager said that there is no sound on the surveillance but that I have threatened one of the members The right version is that I was pushed and threatened by a member who is clearly on steroids in PureGym. He was pushing me away and threatened me violently. The police came and questioned us both. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and did not want to look at the monitoring and assessed that he was not allowed to use both machines at the same time. But according to this manager's the head office will want to make a decision anyway. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and would not look at the monitoring and decided that there was no push on the threat or like. But the video. But, according to this case, the manager's got to the head manager's guy's guy's guy wants to run a guy's guy's quite want to make a decision anyway quite a decision. I made a decision. I made a decision. I made a decision. I have made a decision on the case.",all
64,"Go mood, friendly staff, and cleaning tiptop",all
65,"Cute staff. Nice and clean. Good team training. However, a little small due to a lot of people registering this time of year.",Bogdan
70,"Once again, PureGym proves to me how little their members mean. I meet in this morning to train. There are two women in the bike room who have really loud music, I go in and nicely ask if they won't turn down, where one of them breaks out that it's only for an hour and that they should be allowed to be here, I explain that the same thing applies to me and she just keeps repeating itself, so I just go out again. Later I get an email with a warning because of my inappropriate advice and then find out that one of the two women was a director. I don't get the opportunity to defend myself and tell my side and try to send a complaint to the member service, but also gets rejected and get a short answer to keep the warning. It's pure principle for me and it's so unfair, I've been a member for 10 years + and always behaved properly. To be treated like this after all ",all

80,The age limit is too low and too many rogue members,Bogdan
81,Super atmosphere,all
85,The company lacks innovation - and here I think that changing the name to Pure Gym cannot do it. Recent bad experience: yoga team I was on was so badly heated that I freeze even though I was wearing a long sleeved shirt. Is it supposed to completely abolish the Hot-Yoga teams and instead introduce Frys-Yoga?,Bogdan
87,The center usually works well but within the last 3 weeks there have been errors on several machines - including leg pressure,all
88,Snuffy.Peanut and too expensive gradually. Pyregym name and a little paint do not correct it.,Bogdan

97,Nice to come Puregym always smile staff and helpful,all
98,"I am generally happy with SATS, especially after having better opening hours. Sweet employees and usually good atmosphere on the ""floor."" However, there are some things that could be improved, including faster repair times of defective machines. 2-3 weeks is not all right, but unfortunately often a reality. Besides, you rarely see receptionists more, as these have apparently been given other tasks such as cleaning and cleaning up. I have also seen people go straight into my regular centre several times, without checking in, so unfortunately I also suspect cheating due to the often lack of reception staff. On the wish list is a SATS center in Hillerød:-) Otherwise I am perfectly satisfied with the 2 centres (BLOX and ABC) which I use primarily",all
105,Thanks a lot to Andy from Sats... customer service... he's super helpful... and quickly solved my membership issue.,Bogdan
107,"Great with two directors, it gives a good atmosphere. Good team and talented directors. Unfortunately, the sound snapped a bit along the way and a speaker stopped at some point. However, it was taken care of.It is still a problem with the showers in the locker.",Bogdan
110,"It seems that SATS only focuses on the large centres, for example in inner Copenhagen. I train among others in Vallensbæk. I have trained on the team with functional training for more than 5 years - the director is great. Now the team is closed with the reason that there are not enough participants on the team. No, there are no waiting lists on the team, debt offers quality and social cohesion. That's exactly what the smaller centres can offer, but it's obviously not a factor in SATS unfortunately.",all
112,"I work out in SATS in Nærum and after Thomas has started I've been working out there for 6 years, where the managers have changed out several times. BUT now it's under control. Thomas is present and attentive, the staff is the same and you always get a fresh remark when you come to the training.Here is clean and neat and manage everything. A super feel every time I work out and it's at least 5 times a week •MvhMona •",all
113,"Great center to train in, especially crazy about the sauna(when else it works).",Bogdan
114,"Really delicious machines, good teams, cute employees, value for money, but there could be a need for some extra cleaning in the lady dress in general. Perhaps this is because most men are employed, which therefore does not access the dressing room just as much? But overall it is Nice",all
117,"I have had the most amazing experience at the Sats gym, and I would like to share my enthusiasm. The whole experience has been extremely positive and I would like to thank Andy from customer service. Andy has been extraordinary in helping me with my questions and concerns. His professional and friendly attitude has made all the difference. From start to finish he has been available to answer my questions and make sure that I feel welcome and well taken care of.I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the excellent service I have received from Andy and the rest of the Sats team.",Bogdan

127,"Beware! It doesn't matter how long you are paying member, SATS will cheat you. Smooth billing practices and willingness to go through customers who have been loyal for years without notice when they turn up.",Bogdan
129,"(The review is written after 8 visits to the center over period of two months. In addition, I have a roommate who uses the center considerably more often, who has the same experience) There is a lack of general management of the center, otherwise it wouldn't be so bad... There is a lack of consistent hand alcohol in half of dispensations. - All toilets are grossly disgusting. It looks like no toilets are checked more than 2-3 times a day, which is absurd when you think of the amount of people who use the center daily. Staff should go a round every hour in peak hours, but move rarely from the counter, even when there are more at work. In addition, the toilets smell like a lack of basic cleaning (other than emptying the trash can and cleaning mirror) - no water vending machines, which means that you are forced into disgusting toilets to fill your small water bottle. - Several cabinets in the men's dressing room do not work, which means that it can be difficult to find a closet in any way.",all
132,"SATS Glostrup's sauna is always broken, 2-3 times a month it's broken. The cold shower hasn't worked for 2 months either. Find another center!!",all

136,Good machines - friendly staff - good opening hours - nice that I can take the son with me. Isn't it possible you get a family membership at some point. And an ounce repair of machines shouldn't take two weeks.,Bogdan
137,It is impossible to cancel your subscription regardless of whether I'm physically addressing or trying on the website. Being referred to to try and it doesn't work,Bogdan
138,Training fineBut still no steam bath - but micro sauna. Come on Sats - show that you can offer a little more. What happens there - excuse about high electricity price - does not work,Bogdan
139,"Keeping an eye on your bills - SATS likes to add extra payments without informing you about it.Your systems are in such a poor condition that they remove campaign benefits. In my case, it gave an extra bill on a month's subscription. Furthermore, they provide in the centers a wrong guide when it comes to setting up payment methods. If you sign up after 14th of the month, you must add payment methods to the center so that they can use the chosen method for the coming month. I was told in the center that I should just have done it before the next 14.Your payment department by phone is fairly cold and indifferent to their centers providing incorrect information upon registration. As well as that their systems impose extra payment without it being written anywhere.All in all this is not a business that I personally would trust. They cheat their customers and disbelieve all responsibility.",all

160,It is always a pleasure - for body and soul - to participate in Janicke's hours on Wednesdays. You feel SO well afterwards.,Bogdan
169,"Generally speaking, SATS Valby is a good place to train. They could invest in a little more weightlifting equipment, but it's a small thing. However, they have massive problems with people who don't clean up after themselves. The place is often one big mess where I have to clean up other people's mess before I can get started with my own training.",all
170,"Sats are both and.On the positive side are equipped well and new and there is plenty of space between machines and benches, and the staff are always smiling and friendly.On the negative side. Take headphones with you. SATS insists on playing infinite monotonous counters cover very high, so if you're not in the mood for the sound of high school celebration, bring your own music with you.And it draws a lot in most centers and in all spinnigsals, then bring a jacket to your training",Bogdan

This hasn't happened, despite the fact that I was assured that it would be done today when I called in at 08:30.It's already impeccable that you have to wait from payment to the creation of membership, but it gives an even worse experience when you are given a prospect that doesn't happen.",all
191,"Nice selection for machinery equipment etc. however, unfortunately too hot, summer as winter. Also poor cleaning by machinery and equipment.",all
193,"This review is valid for SATS Falkones at Frederiksberg.There are too many trainers in outdoor shoes and who don't change at all, and if they do, they don't do it in the dressing room, but in the training room, or in the halls for team training. It makes the floor dirty, and it's a little sad when you get yourself into clean indoor shoes. There are also some lockers in the lockers where the doors are pulled off. They have been for months, therefore it would be nice to have them put back on again.There is either no air conditioning in the first part of the center, where machines are trained, or also it doesn't work.The music in the center is often Ganta rap, or hip hop. Thinking more that you should try much music that goes to a wider audience. The group of young people who hear that kind of music doesn't already have earphones in their ears, so they don't hear it ",Bogdan

It is the least you have to offer your members. An indoor climate with heavy, humid air can bother the airways, and it is under all criticism that a fitness centre completely neglects this.",all

Note that unlike most other gyms in the area, this particular Fitness World allows a cheaper membership that is ONLY valid for this one location. If you don't want access to multiple locations, this can yield extra savings.",all

228,"The center at Dannebrosgade made my subscription go from 99 kr, to 259 kr. An increase of 161% the price.

They try to buy every succesfull center in Odense, to dominate the market, and then it becomes worse from there.

They also have Urban Gym which started at 99 kr, but is now 119 kr or something, even though they said they would not raise the price in the beginning.",Bogdan

249,"Bondovej gym has been my regular and favorite gym for the last 2 years. Primarily because, in my opinion, it is the best pure gym center in this part of Odense🙃

equipment :
there is a lot of different equipment to choose from and it mainly consists of technogym plateloaded and machines as well as cable towers and there is a good mix of new and old, which appeals to me as I am a fan and often like the old equipment best. There is a sea of ​​grips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row 🤫

Atmosphere/premises:
The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! 🥰

Service:
The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat 🫠they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odense😉",all
250,"Sport is wonderful. I recommend it without any pretentiousness or show-off, just come and do a workout. Everything is there.",Bogdan
251,"This gym offers all items, equipment and facilities that you would need. There are two big weightlifting areas (including barbells, dumbbells and machines), a big cardio area (treadmills, crosstrainer, stepper, cycles, ...), an area with the usual workout machines, a TRX area and in the one weightlifting area you have some open space to do your own workout (there are spinning ropes, medicine balls, kettleballs, asults, ringes, etc.). Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat). And I really like the 'freestyle' courses like Crossfit and Functional, because they include different equipments and are usually with only a few people so the trainer can focus on you. Everything is very clean, including the shower facilities. There is also a sauna and a steam bath. The ladies changing room comes with big mirrors, hair dryers and hair straightener. It's usually not to crowded and in my opinion super cheap (99 DKK for students).",all
252,Good gym for good people.,Bogdan
256,"Just a very bad gym. Staff don’t really care, don’t blame them tbh it’s miserable in here. All-in deal is bad value. Lots of equipment but the space is pretty sad and windowless",Bogdan
258,"In a huge gym there is only one hair dryer and it’s not working. I asked the staff to fix it one week ago and they told me they will replace it immediately. Today still the same problem and it’s even dangerous as the wire is open. I told the staff guy that I suffered from sinusitis and have to blow my long hair. I even asked him to give me the one in the women’s changing room for few minutes. He said the hair dryer is fixed. When I asked him how is it possible that in such a huge gym there is no other hair dryer, he told me that they didn’t bring the new hair dryer yet and there is no other one. Unacceptable.",Bogdan
259,"It's a great gym with basically everything you could want or need, there is access to lockers both in the dressing rooms and when you enter the center. You enter using a card or bracelet, which is great since it's open 24/7. The only bad thing is that some of the members, don't put their plates and dumbbells back where they belong.",Bogdan

Good machines and nice personnel. In quiet times, this is definitely a place to train. Sometimes, when it's busy, some queueing time for machines, but hasn't been too bad during the month I have been using the gym.
Free entry included in room price for Radisson Hotel guests.",Bogdan
370,"They raise membership prices without any warning, they closes the sauna without any explanations or due date, it takes them weeks to fix broken machines, and the changing room are usually disgusting at all times. No need to mention it is overly expensive, and that they don’t offer membership options (the only one being Mon-Fri until 3pm VS anytime, for 40kr difference). Furthermore, they brand it as Spa when there is only one small sauna which just reopened after several weeks, and is now missing features such as time and sensor. Unacceptable.",all
371,"I worked out here for a few days while passing through. The day pass cost is higher than surrounding gyms, but it is on par with other cities. The facilities are a little old, but the equipment appears to be maintained well. There are plenty of racks, bumper plates, KBs, and dumbbells. The cable circuit machines are separated from the weight room, which is nice. Trainers did not overwhelm equipment or crowd people out. Opens early so you can get done and go to work.",Bogdan
374,"Quite small, so you often have to wait in a queue in order to use the equipment. The machines are placed so close to each other that there are barely any space to walk around them. Rather worn down as well, especially in the locker rooms, where many lockers are broken. Not worth the price.",Bogdan
375,"Recently upgraded with new machines on top floor & Additional weights.
Kept decently clean, usually not too busy, sauna, large stretch/mobility area. Great staff.

The downstairs is where it's at. Racks on racks on racks all with full platforms. + A grass area for sleds and more.",all
376,"Good gym at a great location. Friendly staff. Unfortunately Danes do not know gym etiquette: all weights are left on barbells. That's a big minus, but not fully FitnessDK's fault.",Bogdan
378,"Great friendly, helpful  staff. Spacious training areas…Air conditioning would be nice in summer !!!",Bogdan
379,Why do you have so few group classes comparing to other Sats places? Its unfair,Bogdan
380,Pretty large gym. Large section for CrossFit-type training and even larger section with machines.,Bogdan
382,"Unfortunately the gym is quite filthy all around. You cannot go and stretch on the mats without seeing the whole floor and the mat covered with little flakes (skin, dandruff...) and the smell of sweat. The dressing rooms are not any better. Generally, there should be cleaning happening at least 2-3 times a day. Now I already spoke with the employees and they said that they are doing it themselves and they only do it in the morning. That is a shame that the floor workers are taking care of the cleaning when there should be professionals doing it. This is not good enough. Additionally, the gym equipment and dumbbells are left lying around after use, so you cannot tell whether people are still using them. Not worth the money.",all
383,"Really nice atmosphere. There is a good space for stretching after a work out. Well lit and with lots of natural light through the windows. The staff always say hello and thanks for training when you enter and leave. The changing rooms with sauna and steam room are awesưel.
The classes help me so much! Training in group is such a great time, push you to complete the tasks and achieve your training goals.
Especially, love the yoga class and the room as well",Bogdan
384,"The workers from the reception they don't even move... the service its so so bad... They don't have any qualification, the guy who gave me the subscription he didn't know how much I would payed and he lied to me.. he told me one month free, and I didn't get any month for free.. its was scam. Horrible service.",all
385,"UPDATE: I adjusted my rating because I have had a couple of rude encounters with the staff members. The young guys and girls at the counter really need to be taught how to provide good customer service because their condesending attitude is not affecting the outlook of the gym in a positive way...
------
Pretty decent gym, still missing some basic equipment here and there, but overal it’s a quite okay gym. Some problems I have with this facility:

- Only having one leg extension machine
- No proper pull-up bars with the possibility to do different grips
- Overall, too small free weight section that 9/10 times reeks of testosterone. Literally. It stinks.
- Don’t bother going on weekdays between 16:30/19:00, then your workout will last more than twice as long because of the amount of waiting on equipment and machines.
- The music in the downstairs area is way too loud most of the times. If there was a boxing class going on, fair enough, but that’s usually not the case.
- Classes that take place (and they do a lot) on the rubber matting downstairs take up a lot of space, time and equipment. I make the effort avoiding going to the gym around those times because there won’t be any equipment left to use.

Good things:
- Loads of space compared to other gyms
- Has equipment that regular (cheaper) gyms don’t have > think more CrossFit minded gym set-up
- Enough squat racks (on quiet moments of the day)
- Eleiko weight plates, we like that
- Both mens and womens barbells
- Centrally located
- People training here are more professionally minded, keep to themselves and don’t bother others > the mindset and vibe in this gym is very pleasant.

But other than that it has everything you need and it’s okay priced when you’re a student just visiting this facility. Otherwise, I would probably find a different gym.",Bogdan
386,"Large and spacious center with lots of equipment, however a lot of people go here so it is always crowded. Good for treadmills and such, not the best for weight training as they are either missing or occupied.",Bogdan
387,"For the money you pay the quality of the gym is very low.
- very dirty, everything is sticky
- for some reasons there are like hundreds of cardio machines and limited of lifting machines
- machines placed in a completely random order
- lack of weight plates and no order for these either
- showers slippery one needs to have Spider-Man abilities to walk there
- showers and sauna very dirty
- ok friendly staff",all
390,"+ Big, nice view from some parts
+ Two nice saunas

- Small locker room, pretty dark. The lockers are tricky sometimes
- Crowded. No space because they have put equipment and machines in every corner of this gym?",all
391,"Small but cozy gym. Always very clean, well maintained and in order. The space is very open, doesn't feel suffocating. The equipment feels new. The atmosphere is great — people are respectful and welcoming and the employees are warm and friendly. It's not the biggest gym but has everything you need for weightlifting!",all
393,"Medium size gym with aerobics classes. Instructors and staff are professional and friendly. Amazing view over the water from 1. floor. Parking can at times be challenging and a bit hazardous, as the beach road is quite narrow with a lot of traffic, so be careful when exiting or entering car!",all
394,"The facilities are very good,the stuff is ok,  but the lack of air conditioning at the cardio floor makes it a disgusting sweaty sauna. There are a couple of fans but it's impossible to work out for more than 30 min without feeling you gonna pass out. When the sun hits the glass roof doesn't make it any easier",Bogdan
397,"The legend has it that the Sauna used to function once… it’s been out of order for months now. Escalators always out of order... 4 soap dispenser in men’s shower, always empty. So far worst Sats I’ve been to.",all
398,"While it is spacious and with the ability to brag about a wide variety of equipment, the standard of several machines, is low. Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.

While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)
The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.

All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.",all
402,"If you are looking for the worst gym in Copenhagen, you will find it here.

bad service, and if you are going to train with your partner or friends who know something more than you in the world of fitness
some of the staff will feel threatened to the point of rudely interrupting your training to tell you that you can't do PT in the gym.

It is unfortunate that they focus their job in ruin your experience.

I think I haven’t seen such a bad gym in any part of the world. They doesn’t focus in the client experience at any point. They just take your money and give you bad quality.",Bogdan
406,"Messy, unorganized and strange gym culture. Very urban.",all
409,Mohamad was a great help and went above and beyond. The customer service is top notch and I would recommend Sats to everyone!,all
410,Its a good facilty with 2 floors for working out. All of the staff members are nice and always greet me and tell me goodbye when i leave. Not giving 5 stars because the mens toilet always smells bad. Not counting that a solid 4 stars,Bogdan
412,"I don’t usually write reviews but this is by far the worst gym I have tried in my life. Equipments are old, staff is not friendly/welcoming, minimal classes outside work hours (who’s going to them?!?), no warning that cycling classes need your own shoes (what a waste of time turning up) and I was told there will be English classes (no one spoke English). Save yourself the hassle and join another gym or are all gyms this terrible in cph?",all
415,"Poor service for the price, but its the same with most gyms in copenhagen. Standard equipment, short opening times, very small facility and lack of good hygiene. Membership is way to complicated and overpriced.
Staff is usually nice and its not crowded.",Bogdan
416,"The star is only for friendly staff.
The gym itself is a mess, and looks like no one is keeping it clean.
Sauna not working. Showers are under renovation but they didn’t install emergency showers either. Not even to mention the changing area 🤢 with old fashioned method of lockers.",all
417,"The pictures of the gym must be atleast 10+ old, because the place looks nothing like that. Alot of old equipment, areas that looks like a storage room. Seems like the owner just doesn't care about the state of the place.",Bogdan
420,"Old equipment that seems dirty but probably just used,  small lockers, average service. Way below average in general.",Bogdan
423,"I have been coming here on and off for 5 years. And it gets worse every time I return!
The hygiene in the bath and sauna is under all criticism! Toilet paper, bottles and water on the floor! This is not an isolated case! There needs to be a stronger member policy in the house and more cleaning

Training facilities etc are good",all
425,"Best place to train in kbh, free parking, and really nice helpful staff",all
429,Some of the equipment is old and the facilities could be a lot cleaner. The atmosphere is relaxed though.,Bogdan
430,"Partly reasonable gym in the morning and afternoon, but after that it goes downhill. The evening is terrible: shouting groups of young boys who mostly use Sats as a youth club. But the worst part is that it is filthy in the evening - especially the toilets and bathrooms. There is a lot of snuff and wool from socks in the bathroom that needs to be cleaned - and no one mops the floor (neither staff nor users). The sauna and steam bath (closed) are clammy after a whole day of sweat. People use their own rules regarding the sauna, e.g. having an unofficial party with music in the sauna, so that others cannot enter without stinking of peppermint. The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open). There is also a lot missing compared to previously under Fitnessdk, for example. free coffee. The quality is just decreasing and the clientele is going in the wrong direction: more suspicious types in the evening (and it's not the ones from Gentofte).

Bad gym!!!",all
432,Best workout center,Bogdan
434,"After having been a member of Fitness World for 10 years, I chose to switch to rate and keep then a difference. Better machines, more dumbbells, and much more welcoming staff. It is clearly the best decision I made when I chose to switch to rate.",all
435,"It has now been difficult to find a cabinet that works for a long time. Today I drove home after trying 15 different lockers where the lock didn't work.
Are also tired of their own Corona rules not being followed.
So now I'm changing center.
Otherwise, I was happy to come there, so I hope they will soon get the various things under control so that I can come back.",all
436,"Great fitness centre with nice new facilities. Only downside is the 2 hour limit on the free parking and a limit number of immediate parking spaces. It is usually not a problem.
Good thing I'm reviewing the entire fitness centre and not just giving 1 star because I couldn't figure out the parking facilities like some reviews ;-)",Bogdan
439,fantastic service. nice equipment.,all

Ideally located with a fair day pass for travelers. 5/5",Bogdan
451,"I’ve lived in San Francisco, Japan, Spain and now Copenhagen for a little bit, but this is by far the best gym I have ever been too for the cost. At this location, they have a live DJ from 4 to 8 PM on Monday evenings, and at the other location they have a live DJ at the same time on Tuesday evenings. It’s quite amazing for the price! It’s a nice thing to have as well to spice up the workout.

Plus, they have friendly staff, plenty of lockers to put away your stuff, a Zen room to do your own AI powered workout, and so many machines! Also, they have drinks and protein ice cream bars you can purchase.",all

Nothing worth seeing.",Bogdan
475,"Super cool training, skilled physiotherapist and good atmosphere 💪",Bogdan
476,"Super convenient place as it is in the middle of Nørrebro. The place is a little rusty but it has all needed for exercising and more. Also Arca has many different places all around the city so if you are thinking about starting to do some exercises and taking care of your health, I recommend you to check it out. Trainers are nice and well versed and will guide you through each exercise and movement. Also, they often can take the class in English if you ask. Good fitness journey.",Bogdan
477,"Be careful with the membership disclaimer, they like to take advantage and collect money scamming you. I didn't use the facilities for 6 months because of health issues [among other things], and they  sent me a letter and charged me KR 1,109. Horrible experience for me, they lost a customer for ever.",Bogdan
478,"Some instructors should be trained better on how to react in case person gets an injury in class. I had an overall good experience with CrossFit Copenhagen, but one unqualified teacher with unprofessional behavior made me change my mind.
Basics should be obvious - if someone at your class gets heavily injured, you need to take care of them and help, not just ask them leave immediately.",Bogdan
479,"Outrageous company. Complete absence of professionalism or customer service. ALL of my classes got cancelled last month for some unknown reason, and Crossfit CPH refused to refund me for the membership. This kind of ""Just deal with it - we don't care about you"" attitude from them, is incredibly annoying. I will cancel my membership as soon as I can.",Bogdan
480,"Same here, I had registered too and cancelled on time but they charged 300 dkk for no reason and there is no number to call them either - how is that possible and makes me wonder which century are we living in? All big talks and show off! zero professionalism.",Bogdan
481,"Great gym, they also have physical therapy (how I know this place) and what ever workout you like. They have a tons of classes from yoga, spinning, crossfit, pilates, TRX, dance and all the machines you would want in a gym. They have big changing rooms and showers and lockers. All the personal I have met so far were super friendly. They have competitive prices.",Bogdan
482,"Favorite gym. Machines and the fitness program is very good, there is a classy boutique fitness atmosphere . The members are also better than many other fitness clubs I tried. I have been member of the place for nearly four years and visit minimum five times a week 😉💪",Bogdan
