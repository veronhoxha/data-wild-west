I could understand on the manager who was working today (26/10/23 at 13.30) that the head office has decided to banish me for 2 years for threats which is the lie. Furthermore, the manager said that there is no sound on the surveillance but that I have threatened one of the members The right version is that I was pushed and threatened by a member who is clearly on steroids in PureGym. He was pushing me away and threatened me violently. The police came and questioned us both. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and did not want to look at the monitoring and assessed that he was not allowed to use both machines at the same time. But according to this manager's the head office will want to make a decision anyway.

There are two women in the bike room who have really loud music, I go in and nicely ask if they won't turn down, where one of them breaks out that it's only for an hour and that they should be allowed to be here, I explain that the same thing applies to me and she just keeps repeating itself, so I just go out again. Later I get an email with a warning because of my inappropriate advice and then find out that one of the two women was a director. I don't get the opportunity to defend myself and tell my side and try to send a complaint to the member service, but also gets rejected and get a short answer to keep the warning.

However, there are some things that could be improved, including faster repair times of defective machines. 2-3 weeks is not all right, but unfortunately often a reality. Besides, you rarely see receptionists more, as these have apparently been given other tasks such as cleaning and cleaning up. I have also seen people go straight into my regular centre several times, without checking in, so unfortunately I also suspect cheating due to the often lack of reception staff. On the wish list is a SATS center in Hillerød:-) Otherwise I am perfectly satisfied with the 2 centres (BLOX and ABC) which I use primarily",all
110,"It seems that SATS only focuses on the large centres, for example in inner Copenhagen. I train among others in Vallensbæk. I have trained on the team with functional training for more than 5 years - the director is great. Now the team is closed with the reason that there are not enough participants on the team. No, there are no waiting lists on the team, debt offers quality and social cohesion. That's exactly what the smaller centres can offer, but it's obviously not a factor in SATS unfortunately.",all

129,"(The review is written after 8 visits to the center over period of two months. In addition, I have a roommate who uses the center considerably more often, who has the same experience) There is a lack of general management of the center, otherwise it wouldn't be so bad... There is a lack of consistent hand alcohol in half of dispensations. - All toilets are grossly disgusting. It looks like no toilets are checked more than 2-3 times a day, which is absurd when you think of the amount of people who use the center daily. Staff should go a round every hour in peak hours, but move rarely from the counter, even when there are more at work. In addition, the toilets smell like a lack of basic cleaning (other than emptying the trash can and cleaning mirror) - no water vending machines, which means that you are forced into disgusting toilets to fill your small water bottle. - Several cabinets in the men's dressing room do not work, which means that it can be difficult to find a closet in any way.",all

If you sign up after 14th of the month, you must add payment methods to the center so that they can use the chosen method for the coming month. I was told in the center that I should just have done it before the next 14.Your payment department by phone is fairly cold and indifferent to their centers providing incorrect information upon registration.

249,"Bondovej gym has been my regular and favorite gym for the last 2 years. Primarily because, in my opinion, it is the best pure gym center in this part of Odense🙃

equipment :
there is a lot of different equipment to choose from and it mainly consists of technogym plateloaded and machines as well as cable towers and there is a good mix of new and old, which appeals to me as I am a fan and often like the old equipment best. There is a sea of ​​grips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row 🤫

Atmosphere/premises:
The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! 🥰

Service:
The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat 🫠they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odense😉",all
251,"This gym offers all items, equipment and facilities that you would need. There are two big weightlifting areas (including barbells, dumbbells and machines), a big cardio area (treadmills, crosstrainer, stepper, cycles, ...), an area with the usual workout machines, a TRX area and in the one weightlifting area you have some open space to do your own workout (there are spinning ropes, medicine balls, kettleballs, asults, ringes, etc.). Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat). And I really like the 'freestyle' courses like Crossfit and Functional, because they include different equipments and are usually with only a few people so the trainer can focus on you. Everything is very clean, including the shower facilities. There is also a sauna and a steam bath. The ladies changing room comes with big mirrors, hair dryers and hair straightener. It's usually not to crowded and in my opinion super cheap (99 DKK for students).",all
271,Relative okay gym. Matrix machines are not the best and the Nautilus were better before renovation. Dumbbells are not put in the correct location and it is always overcrowded. Not enough machines compared to the demand.,Christian
272,They changed the cost of a guest fee from 50kr to 69kr and the new Matrix equipment is so so so uncomfortable. Since PureGym took over this place it is easily the worst gym in Østerbro!,Christian

SATS have a bunch of different spots in Copenhagen and if you don't like the size, there are always others.

Personally, I feel like this is one of the better, if you just want to get in and do a workout and get out. You'll rarely wait for a spot anywhere.

They have everything you need including 6 squat racks / power cages and a bunch of free weight stuff, cardio machines. The only thing lacking is team workout.

The changing rooms are good and spacious.

It does get extremely hot in the summer here, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.",Christian

That is a shame that the floor workers are taking care of the cleaning when there should be professionals doing it. This is not good enough.

398,"While it is spacious and with the ability to brag about a wide variety of equipment, the standard of several machines, is low. Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.

While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)
The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.

All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.",all

Sauna not working. Showers are under renovation but they didn’t install emergency showers either. Not even to mention the changing area 🤢 with old fashioned method of lockers.",all
423,"I have been coming here on and off for 5 years. And it gets worse every time I return!
The hygiene in the bath and sauna is under all criticism! Toilet paper, bottles and water on the floor! This is not an isolated case! There needs to be a stronger member policy in the house and more cleaning

Training facilities etc are good",all
424,"A nice training centre, with good opportunities for self-training with - or without the use of machines and for booking on different teams, if you want. There is a good atmosphere when you walk in the door, and it is my clear impression that the employees do their best to ensure that Sats - Rødovre continues to be a nice place to visit.",Christian
425,"Best place to train in kbh, free parking, and really nice helpful staff",all
430,"Partly reasonable gym in the morning and afternoon, but after that it goes downhill. The evening is terrible: shouting groups of young boys who mostly use Sats as a youth club. But the worst part is that it is filthy in the evening - especially the toilets and bathrooms. There is a lot of snuff and wool from socks in the bathroom that needs to be cleaned - and no one mops the floor (neither staff nor users). The sauna and steam bath (closed) are clammy after a whole day of sweat. People use their own rules regarding the sauna, e.g. having an unofficial party with music in the sauna, so that others cannot enter without stinking of peppermint. The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open). There is also a lot missing compared to previously under Fitnessdk, for example. free coffee. The quality is just decreasing and the clientele is going in the wrong direction: more suspicious types in the evening (and it's not the ones from Gentofte).

Bad gym!!!",all
434,"After having been a member of Fitness World for 10 years, I chose to switch to rate and keep then a difference. Better machines, more dumbbells, and much more welcoming staff. It is clearly the best decision I made when I chose to switch to rate.",all
435,"It has now been difficult to find a cabinet that works for a long time. Today I drove home after trying 15 different lockers where the lock didn't work.
Are also tired of their own Corona rules not being followed.
So now I'm changing center.
Otherwise, I was happy to come there, so I hope they will soon get the various things under control so that I can come back.",all
439,fantastic service. nice equipment.,all
440,"Super delicious place with all imaginable training tools from turf, weights and general cardio to cross-country skiing. Lots of air and light and nice changing rooms. There is free parking.
Remember that you must use the padlock here and not the membership card for the lockers",all
451,"I’ve lived in San Francisco, Japan, Spain and now Copenhagen for a little bit, but this is by far the best gym I have ever been too for the cost. At this location, they have a live DJ from 4 to 8 PM on Monday evenings, and at the other location they have a live DJ at the same time on Tuesday evenings. It’s quite amazing for the price! It’s a nice thing to have as well to spice up the workout.

Plus, they have friendly staff, plenty of lockers to put away your stuff, a Zen room to do your own AI powered workout, and so many machines! Also, they have drinks and protein ice cream bars you can purchase.",all
490,"If you like to get Energy into your bloodstream, that’s the place to go. ☀️
The personnel is also very nice and helpful 👍",all
491,Good place with proper equipment but horrible ventilation 😅 not good for summer 😅 but you can get to see nice views,Christian
492,"It's okay, has its variety but could use 1-2 more machines",Christian
493,"Big with most facilities, but almost always very crowded.",Christian
494,Amazing place !!!,Christian
495,"Don't spend time or effort giving them constructive criticism even if they ask for clarification on the bad review of the center in their app because they are not willing to improve anything even though they claim they will do everything to improve. They just want to use long emails to basically say ""That's just how it is""... Not one of them I would train in permanently as they are pretty bad machines compared to other centers... There are others in Aalborg that are far better..",Christian
496,"Best gym in Aalborg city center!!! I have been training in this gym 5 times per week since 2015. Compare to other fitness world gym in Aalborg city center, this one is THE BEST. Always clean everywhere - machines, bathrooms, and even the training mat! Offers a lot of equipments, and many different training classes you can choose.",Christian
497,Ever since it became Pure gym they removed all the hand sanitizer. Disgusting place,Christian
498,"Nice place, but can be quite crowded at times leading to extended waiting for the machine that you wish to use. The equipment itself is all good though.",Christian
500,"Amazing gym, and most lovely staff ever!",Christian
501,"Have been coming here for 4-5 years. All around good gym, isn’t ever too packed, has a good amount of specifically the machines/equipment that is in high demand such as squat racks, benches, pulldown machines etc. but no fancy stuff, only “essential” standard equipment. Prices are also good for beginners but I think a little high if you’ve been training here for a while and there are no beginner benefits left.",Christian
502,Don’t like it at all. People who work there is never there.,Christian
503,"Been a memeber for 6 years. Great gym with a large space, not fully packed with all sorts of machines, but there are still enough machines. Really love it. The music is quiet too, though it could be a bit lowered on Sundays. Still, a great palce, love coming here :)",Christian
506,Great for the daily grind this or another fitness world workes wonders,Christian
507,Everything I need !!! Thx,Christian
508,"Overall good center with proportionally good amount of machines compared to popularity. However, there is no hip thrust bench and only high benches, which means I have to go to another center for that exercise. dB is somewhat heavier than the other centers and the jumps between each weight are incredibly large at 2-3 kg. per steps. Bathing facilities could be better located. Nice and clean center which appears clearly. Lots of water points.",Christian
509,Good facilities and good energy from the movers.,Christian
510,always clean and attractive premises,Christian
511,This is one of the best centrres of Fitness world in Aalborg on the basis of the size and equipments,Christian
512,"This is from PureGym on Gugvej and Friis in Aalborg. They are some good and spacious centers with a lot of machines, so you don't feel like you are stalling during your training. On Gugvej there is good parking! Nice places.🤗",Christian
514,"The training and the facilities are ok, but the last two times I've been there there has been a lack of toilet paper and/or paper towels in the men's changing room. The cleaning has not been ok either.",Christian
515,Can't find a better place,Christian
516,"A good, big center, with almost everything you could need.",Christian
517,Good service. Versatile options for training. Good mood. Room for everyone.,Christian
518,"Super good service, but I think there are too few bench press racks and too few toilets, this may well cause a lot of waiting time, there could also be more water dispensers around, with this the prices also start to become too high, otherwise a fine training place.",Christian
519,Too little space when it is busy and not enough machines. But otherwise I think there is a nice variety and the machines are in good condition,Christian
520,"Bad parking conditions. Had to stop at Lidl and when I got to the center the door was locked - Normally it's not a problem, but this center apparently requires a special chip in the card that can only be obtained during opening hours. This was not stated on the website!",Christian
522,I really like training here. Everything is clean and in good conditions. The equipment is great; there are many options. The staff is very friendly and always makes you feel comfortable.,Christian
523,"Small and exclusive gym, One of the thing that pissed me most about it was that I wanted to use just the gym, which in all other gym from the Fitness world franchise cost 150 DKK, however this is not permitted and they require you to make a full membership for their gym and classes, even if you dont want to visit any of them, which is 250 DKK. As i said exclusive.",Christian
524,"Good center for training, one of the original centers in Aalborg.",Christian
525,"This is the best fitnes. First it's close to me, second it is very big.",Christian
527,Very fine place,Christian
528,It's good with less variety of equipments.,Christian
529,They are trying to kill you! I guess that is the point..? :),Christian
530,A really spacious and organized gym,Christian
531,Very nice gym…. Clean and well equipped…,Christian
532,You can find several training equipment for chest and shoulders in the first floor,Christian
533,A decent place to workout 👌🏼,Christian
534,24 hour open,Christian
535,Nice place😉,Christian
536,"The balance at the gym have been broken for months, I have been waiting to weight myself and see how fat I am atm for too long",Christian
537,"Has everything there needs to be at a gym but there is a bit crowded sometimes so you might have to wait in line for some things, but it's rare. Overall great gym",Christian
538,One of my go-to fitness world centres in Aarhus. Lots of options and lots of space.,Christian
539,Predatory payment practices,Christian
540,"The equipment is so worn out, the cable machines squeak and bind and there is only one lat pulldown machine. The hipthrust machine is far too tall and cannot be adjusted for women. In general, a super worn out gym and it doesn't help to paint the walls...",Christian
541,"Amazing gym with two floors, therefore enough space for everyone. Highly recommended for trainings in the heart of Aarhus.",Christian
543,Excellent gym that's just recently been revamped. Has everything including full machine setups and free weights. Spacious and has a nice dressing room and sauna. Conveniently located right in the middle of town.,Christian
544,One of the best Fitness Worlds I have been in. It has a good selection of all the gear you need. Not too crowded in the morning and a major plus is that there is a sauna and a steam bath.,Christian
545,Among all the centers in Aarhus. This particular center has the sauna facility. New and well designed. Can be too much crowded after 15:00 until 20:00,Christian
547,They say biggest gym in scandinavia. This place is really cool! People are lovely. Can bit crowded in aftetnoons,Christian
548,Amazing cardio classes with great atmosphere!,Christian
549,"Quantity over quality, very over rated, expensive. Poor cleaning and poorly organized both from the customers and the employees. Dumbbells lying everywhere, weight bars every where on the floor, racks missing dumbbells for days is a normal thing. So many machines that are so close to each other it is impossible to move around without hitting something by accident. Not very friendly staff.",Christian
550,Fantastic place to stay fit!,Christian
551,well equiped and very kind staff ☺️ always smiling,Christian
585,"Not the biggest Fitness World, you can safely say, there aren't many parking spaces. So you have to stop at Bilka if you come in prime time, i.e. around 16 to 18:00.

The place is open until 00:00 on weekdays, so that everyone can get a workout in. There isn't bikefit and all that cycling like in the really big centres.",all
604,"Old and No ergonomic equipment for free weights.
Benches are broken and probably at least 30 years old. They cannot fold due to broken mechanisms.
Towers are old and half broken.

Seriously one of the worst equipped gyms I have seen.",all
607,Its nice Gym to work out its clean and well organize 😊,all
608,Its a nice and clean gym💪. Bra personal. I love it,all
609,One the my  favourite place!!!,all
