Despite leaving the country and clearly cancelling my membership, this gym continued to charge me a recurring fee, month after month. I was shocked and frustrated to see this charge appearing on my credit card statement, especially as I was no longer in the country and had no access to their facilities.\n\nThe customer service provided by this gym was equally disappointing. I tried reaching out to them multiple times, via email, to rectify this issue but my requests were ignored or brushed off. It took a significant amount of time and effort on my part but they had no interest in resolving the issue.\n\nIn my opinion, this gym is clearly more concerned about lining their pockets rather than providing a quality service to their customers. Their lack of attention to customer service and unethical billing practices is unacceptable and I would not recommend this gym to anyone.

It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.\n\nMoreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded.","annotator":"Veron"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-31T15:22:27.712696Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T13:11:23.888135Z","inner_id":679,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":680,"annotations":[{"id":177,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"taxonomy":[["Positive"]]},"id":"aoKRlncIwX","from_name":"taxonomy","to_name":"text","type":"taxonomy","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-02T13:11:36.893635Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T13:11:36.893635Z","draft_created_at":"2023-11-02T13:11:32.647838Z","lead_time":11.115,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"e21c1781-a6c7-47b7-bbdf-e478698a5c19","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":680,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"c08731dc-dataset_for_annotations.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Unnamed: 0":679,"author_name":"D Kar","text":"Huge training space.

No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.\n\nWhile heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof.

It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.\n\nIf you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.\n\nI don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there.

Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.\nWhen I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership.
