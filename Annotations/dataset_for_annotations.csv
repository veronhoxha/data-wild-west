I would like if there was a rule about going outside the shoes out at the entrance and also cleaning the shower drain system more often. Hair gets clogged up up there and it smells. It would also be nice if everyone could contribute more by, for example, putting the weights back where they belong!!!",all
3,Hanne Andersen,Feel welcome to me.Good directors.But please put up notes that the girls have to close the closet when they go. It annoys me boundlessly that they yawn and you walk into them.,all

First day starts out that you have to pick up your card at the reception, however, you cannot get to the reception without a card and when you press the bell there is nothing. When you finally have your card continues the problems. Come down to train, check in, see I have forgotten the mik water bottle, home after it, come back and can not come in.

They joined me and made me an offer that I agreed to, but they didn't inform me that there was a six-month bond.When I resigned about two weeks later, since I thought there were too little machines, I wrote to customer service and explained the misunderstanding when it was only there I discovered it. They said it wasn't their fault, but my responsibility since it was on the receipt, and they refused to help. After a conversation back and forth where I asked them if we could find a solution, I got rude messages back, but at last they changed the resignation.This was a super frustrating experience where I felt cheated and downed by the staff. Even though we had changed the date of the termination, I didn't report back to PureGym if this is the way in which they solved misunderstandings, whether or not.",all

59,Jonas Vesth,"I tried to create a membership in a plus membership when you saved 30% for the next 6 months if you were a student. After I activated this discount on the website it wasn't activated when I had to pay when another campaign (which was more expensive) apparently overlapd the study discount.So I went down to one of your centers and tried to set me up there, but neither did I manage to get started with the 30% study discount, despite the employee calling her boss. Here she did a good attempt.So unfortunately it was the weekend and I couldn't contact customer service until after the weekend. In between the campaign is apparently over. I get written to the chat today and meet the most incompetent young worker who after I explained my situation, writes ""We unfortunately don't have the discount anymore."" There is absolutely no help to pick up from customer service from Oliver..",all

93,Klaus,"There has gradually been general dissatisfaction among members, on the level of cleaning and on the condition of the machinery. The paradox is that the price has increased while the quality has gone down. In this respect, it is also disappointing to hear that the centre on Østervoldgade is apparently a low priority centre.Everything suggests that Østervoldgade could be a good centre: good size, in the middle city and delicious rooms, but it requires effort, in line with the one previously established.The centre has been run very competently in the FW days by female center managers, so no names have been mentioned.",all

My son cannot sign up as I pay and I can't unsubscribe as the email address doesn't fit. It is closed for support this weekend and since I finally find a physical store with staffing it is October 1st. They know that he can't use the 2 extra months membership - since he is in Italy - which we are now forced to pay but yet demand that we pay for October and November - as their rules say. Very little service-minded. Find a better and cheaper place.,all

I am very satisfied and could not imagine me training in other center. Good atmospheres and cute employee. Always clean and nice.

But otherwise I can only recommend PureGym.",all

117,Sussie Persson,Maintaining 1 star - I could give less I did - reply from Lukas clearly shows that they were totally equally happy with the customers - and no she wasn't cleaning it was long gone. PureGym has become a money machine - had today - for the first time forgotten my card and had to have help getting in - the price of opening the door is 30 kr - that despite being a regular customer for almost 2 years and putting money in their store for 6 months at a time - I am furious it is by no means all right,Gino

123,Steen Jæger,"A cardio machine park that is mildly indecent. The staff do what they can and there's nothing wrong there. But the center doesn't live up to any standard at all. Keep offers that are completely ridiculous. It seems as if the Sønderborg center has run out of the group's focus and just has to sail its own lake in the best possible way. It's almost embarrassing to say you train in PureGym in Sønderborg when you're asked where you're training. Now get the otherwise cool center updated to present standards. You see your advertising spots on TV in the center with advertising to train on various machines that so many people don't even find in the center. The other centres in town have gradually got new engine parks and chatter about people who go to other centers, which can be seen clearly at certain times when before there were many out to train in the morning/morning day for you to almost have the center for yourself today.",Gino

Equipment not extremely new but very well kept, good space and when you join, they also offer a free coaching/personal session to guide you! 💪",Gino
169,Alissa Orr,"Fantastic gym with tons of equipment. Plenty of options and plenty of space to move around. Lots of racks, benches, dumbbells, kettlebells, bands. Cardio equipment includes plenty of treadmills, bikes, stair climbers, etc.

Plenty of lockers available and I was offered a combo lock if needed. Affordable day pass (60 dkk) was easy to pay. There was always an employee at or near the front desk who was quick to help.",Gino
170,Oussama K,"Best gym I’ve ever went to. Very friendly staff, fully equiped with everything and a great Schwarzi painting.
Ideally located with a fair day pass for travelers. 5/5",Gino
171,Amit K Mishra,All modern equipment are available at a reasonable subscription rate. Definitely I will join soon.,Gino
172,Mikkel Thygesen,"Good facilities, but it is in dire need of better climate control. It's only about 19c outside now but the inside the gym is burning (when doing workouts obviously). The group hall is even worse because they're not allowed to open the windows.",Gino
173,Christian Haugbølle,"Signed up and regretted my subscription within the 14 days cancellation period. I had a very, very hard time getting them to understand that I should not pay for the rest of the month + 1 month if I cancelled within 14 days (they even asked if I had actually READ their terms, which I had ... and turned out their center-leader had not, which was very awkward for her). I can't recommend Fitness World.",Gino
174,D Kar,"Huge training space. Good quality classes. Would be great for me if instructor use a little bit of English too for the people who don't speak danish.
I like fitness world.",Gino
175,Ivan Vlasov,"I checked on their website that they are open and offer one-time visit. I came, waited for 10 minutes - no administrator appeared (the client/members were there), and then I left this place.",Gino
176,Julie Taeko,"I’ve lived in San Francisco, Japan, Spain and now Copenhagen for a little bit, but this is by far the best gym I have ever been too for the cost. At this location, they have a live DJ from 4 to 8 PM on Monday evenings, and at the other location they have a live DJ at the same time on Tuesday evenings. It’s quite amazing for the price! It’s a nice thing to have as well to spice up the workout.

Plus, they have friendly staff, plenty of lockers to put away your stuff, a Zen room to do your own AI powered workout, and so many machines! Also, they have drinks and protein ice cream bars you can purchase.",Gino
177,Cyrus Hiatt,"Fantastic gym. I have been working out there for about 4 months now and enjoy the equipment, staff, and the fact that they are open 24/7. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a new gym in Copenhagen.",Gino
178,Mikkel Anderson,"Go here at night and it is like getting into a night club, great atmosphere and music is almost always on point!
There is a guy here, think he is called Rasmus, always smiling and welcoming. He gets you in a mood that forces all great energy into you and makes the lifts much better. Would highly recommend going here, and in Repeat I general!",Gino
179,Alberte Schmidt Koefoed,"Love the interior of this gym. Much better than any other gym I have tried. They have a great selection of equipment. However, the music is sometimes really really loud and the place can get quite busy during peek hours.",Gino
180,eclipseNF,"This gym has really terrible policies for drop in, day pass people, such as tourists like myself. I went there at 3:15pm on a Saturday, and the staff member told me I couldn't train because he was leaving at 4pm, and I was not allowed to let myself out of the gym without a staff member being there, even though it's a 24 hour gym and was full of people. Very bad policy for taking care of casual people like me who really want to train.",Gino
181,Carlos Olivo,Very nice gym. I got a week pass for 110 dkk or something like that wich is really surprisingly cheap for this quality gym. You can also do daily passes. The only thing to bear in mind that after 6pm and on the weekends there is no one to check you in so come before if you want to singup and then you can use the gym using a card until midnight.,Gino
182,Martha V. Shelton,"well appointed gym; not crowded mid
morning",Gino
183,Thomas Jakins,"Never really too busy but it is quite small. Like alot of fitness worlds it could update the machines.
Generally its very clean, its one of the better fitness worlds.",Gino
184,Hendrik H,Gym has only very limited service times. Impossible to workout after this time if you only want to workout for a day.,Gino
185,Sharad Govil,Great Gym- I was a bit nervous as this is my first time to a gym in Denmark but the front staff was very friendly and helpful. For 99DKK I could get a pass for a week. It opens from 5:30 AM to 10:00 PM. The timing showed in google is when front staff is available. You need an access card to enter so if you are first times from overseas go after 8:00 AM so staff can open the door for you.,Gino
186,Jon H,"Great gym and CrossFit lessons, I usually do drop in when I visit CPH. If you do not speak Dannish and are looking to do a drop in CrossFit avoid classes with the coach John David, he has a lack of interest and not welcoming to new members, the rest of the coaches are great.
I totally recommend this friendly gym.",Gino
187,Peter Hagström,Best crossfitbox I’ve been to so far! They got it all and is a must visit if you love Crossfit and is in town. Friendly people and great classes.,Gino

190,Can Deger,"The best gym by far, I have seen in CPH",Gino
191,J Masnec,"Ok gym for a chain. Slection of machines is good, slection of classes not so good. Not crowded. Highlight is the two squash terrains. Downside - you cant reserve them online if you're not a squash member. Fitness membership doesnt help, you have to have a seperate squash membership.",Gino
192,Isabel Monteiro,"Jesus Christ..
this place needs a deep cleaning !!!!  The shower is full of spiderwebs, the mats were all very wet of sweat..

Be careful at the room were they do boxing the wood floor is very slippery

Not enough  hygge but:

Friendly employees !
Cool time at the boxing class!",Gino
193,Ewa Palenta-Rusin,"I give 1 star more than #fitnessworld actually deserves for the great ""hold"" instructors. Otherwise it is a poor service fitness center that want to rip you off at every turn. I got a special offer when I signed up because it was FW birthday - ""All-in"" free for one month. It was the end of month and I did not get to use it at all. But to my big astonishment, it was an opt-in subscription service, so I was actually billed for the next month without even being notified beforehand! I cancelled it right away but I had to pay for that month anyway. So I used it a few times. And here comes the next surprise - again I was billed for the product I ""bought"" on top of my monthly fee.
I am asking, is that what a reputable fitness chain do? I doubt..",Gino
194,William Maddocks,"One of the better fitness worlds, nice and open, high ceilings, nice facilities.

Only thing that stopped it being 5 stars is the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom/shower areas sometimes",Gino

196,Bartosz Gałecki,"Air conditioning is not turned on. Instead they put a couple of fans around the gym, which just move hot air around. Not super clean but I've been to worse places. Some machines are broken for weeks without maintenance.

Good thing is that people put the weights back",Gino
197,wandyr hagge,"Nice place for a work out. Clean. Fairly good equipments. Within the price range of other facilities. A bit under-staffed, in my opinion. Difficult to find someone to ask a question. And even If you find someone, It is not sure you will get an answer...",Gino

200,Mikhail Nikitin,"One can talk about broken machines or dirt in the changing rooms, but I realize that things can't be ideal all the time. So I'd say it all goes relatively well until one needs to talk to someone beyond the helping guys in the centre. The company doesn't have a phone number to call. They have a chat, which main purpose seems to relay a message ""Fill in the online contact form"". When you do, there is a waiting time from hours to days. And if you get an answer, it never changes regardless whether you can prove them wrong or lying. They merely stop responding. And there's nothing you can say to someone who is not willing to listen.",Gino
201,Bas Klerk,"Great gym. It’s relatively small but has plenty of cables, freeweights and squat racks, so really everything you need. Very kind staff and chill atmosphere.",Gino

I recommend to nobody subscribe there . They don’t care about the occupancy… (may be we need new covid pandemy) sale and sale new memberships. Also they grow up with the price ? For what? Unfortunately I’m looking for other place with a months; just here is noone option. I hope other companies make good the marketing.

Will not be coming back.",Gino

It's got infinite running things, stay-still-pedallers, heavy handles, pull ropes, hard-to-pick-up-if-you're-weak balls, make-your-life-difficult machines and hulahoops. All are kept well maintained and on a leash if necessary. According to rumors, there are also classes for different things but I don't know anything about that. Get the app,  it helps with stuff I've never used and looks nice.

The place is clean and neat, and the atmoshpere is relaxed. A special plus about this center is the high ceilings making the air circulation very nice. Staff is always smiling and friendly, never felt that it was overcrowded with visitors, even at peak hours.",Gino

I will never ever update my membership again in your gym, (take my money for nothing).",Bogdan
227,Angi Las,"The Studio is not in best Shape. As Many before me wrote: it’s very small, the devices are packed!! Could be a lot cleaner - especially the toilets.
But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.
Will go to another fitness world studio in the future and hope that the next one will be more modern and clean und the staff maybe a little more educated.",Bogdan
228,Daniel Storm,"Watch out! In the mens changing rooms there are someone unscrewing the locks so they can open the lockers even if you have your own lock on.

This has been a big problem over the last year. And Fitness World do not inform you about this!!!!",Bogdan
229,Eduardo Simões,"Attention! I have noticed some screws missing in the locks of the locker room (males). This allows the door to be opened even with a lock. Always choose a locker with screws as the screws cannot be removed with a lock on. Also, booking system is problematic.",Bogdan

232,donny,"This gym has seen better days. Devices are old, often broken or make squeaking noises. Steam sauna closed down permanently. Regular sauna and showers are broken since weeks. Not worth the high fees. You find better gyms in Copenhagen for half of the price.",Bogdan
233,Dan Leonhardt,"Wasted potential. This could be a good gym, but their obvious desire to minimize spending really hurts the customer experience.

Equipment is broken for weeks (sometimes months) at a time. Showers work intermittently, and when down, also take weeks to fix.

Locker room has lots of almost all half size lockers (many of which are broken) and these are only half occupied even at peak times. So why not install a room of full length lockers and keep them in working order? That would cost money. Can't do that it would seem.

There was a steam room. It was closed in early 2022, supposedly due to high energy prices at the time. Never reopened. No reason given, other then the ridiculous argument that somehow, by keeping it open, the whole business would fail and the gym would then have to close down.

And the minimal staffing means there's nobody to enforce the rules (CLEAN THE MACHINE WHEN YOU ARE DONE!) or do little things like fill up soap dispensers in the bathrooms and showers.",Bogdan

Trainers are nice and well versed and will guide you through each exercise and movement. Also, they often can take the class in English if you ask. Good fitness journey.",Bogdan
242,gabriela geneyro,"Be careful with the membership disclaimer, they like to take advantage and collect money scamming you.

243,Ievgeniia,"Some instructors should be trained better on how to react in case person gets an injury in class. I had an overall good experience with CrossFit Copenhagen, but one unqualified teacher with unprofessional behavior made me change my mind.

257,Rune Perstrup,"An Unhygienic Coronavirus Petri Dish.

I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously.",Bogdan
258,Mario Piazza,"In a huge gym there is only one hair dryer and it’s not working. I asked the staff to fix it one week ago and they told me they will replace it immediately. Today still the same problem and it’s even dangerous as the wire is open. I told the staff guy that I suffered from sinusitis and have to blow my long hair. I even asked him to give me the one in the women’s changing room for few minutes. He said the hair dryer is fixed. When I asked him how is it possible that in such a huge gym there is no other hair dryer, he told me that they didn’t bring the new hair dryer yet and there is no other one. Unacceptable.",Bogdan
259,Emil Lassen,"It's a great gym with basically everything you could want or need, there is access to lockers both in the dressing rooms and when you enter the center. You enter using a card or bracelet, which is great since it's open 24/7. The only bad thing is that some of the members, don't put their plates and dumbbells back where they belong.",Bogdan
260,Frank Ejby Poulsen,"The gym is great, spacious and has everything, and the personel is friendly and helpful.

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded.",Bogdan
261,Joonas Toivonen,"Good gym at a great location. Friendly staff. Unfortunately Danes do not know gym etiquette: all weights are left on barbells. That's a big minus, but not fully FitnessDK's fault.",Bogdan

SHC personnels are professional. The trainers care about you and all members during the class, explain every movement, and give feedback at that moment. There is no language barrier, we communicate in English. Changing rooms are clean. They pay attention to the hygiene of the environment and the commonly used equipment.
I recommend SHC Scandinavia for those who are looking for a different option. Before the membership go and visit them. They will answer all of your questions :)",Bogdan

The gym is clean and specious, it’s more suitable for functional training than weightlifting although it has dumbbells rack and a couple of cable machines. Personal trainers are very common there and they can be powerful that they hang on to multiple machines at once for their trainees without giving a timeframe when they will let go of one of the machines with the “I’m still using it” attitude. So better hire a trainer or you’ll end up doing cardio only.",Bogdan

287,Charlotte Krogh,"Worst High School in Denmark. If not in the whole world. Don't let your kids go there. Unprofessional teachers and principal who do not take the students seriously when they come with an inquiry and problem. Teachers kept their distance when they knew the student was not vaccinated and made inappropriate and unnecessary comments. Students are treated differently and differently based on their race and ethnicity. Teachers who could come up with comments
and statements such as ""You can run me to Christmas"" and ""I hope you don't come to the exam, because then you will all fail"". This high school goes to great lengths to present itself as ""competent citizens"", but this is not the case at all. On the contrary. This high school is the reason why many previous students have not been able to study their dream education, as they give unfair grades WITHOUT making arguments for the applicable grade. The teachers at this high school tend to ask the students to appear interested and nice ""what education do you want to pursue in your near future"" so they can be sure to destroy your dream with unfair grades and feedback.",Bogdan

It doesn't really matter which field of study you choose, as you will most likely never work with it in high school.

In the changing rooms there is always a lack of paper and soap in the showers.

369,Krzysztof Turczyn,"This place is great!
They have all you need and they're open 24 hours, if it was even a bit dirty it's because lazy members do not know how to behave! People working there are trainers and office staff they are not your slave and they are not there to clean you mess! But there is one thing that drives me crazy and I was trying to ignore it but it is a bit hard now... the music when the staff leaves. If any staff employee of FW is reading it, can you PLEASE contact the staff in this gym and asked them to when they leave at 8 PM maybe set some radio or some motivational music? There was this one day that the song got stuck it was play allllllllllll night long, the same one song, and it was not even a good one, and literally after 40 mins I left coz not even my headphones helped. And yesterday there was some country music. In general after 8 there is always ""not the best music"" and I think if it's like this I'd prefer to work out in silence.
But otherwise as I mentioned great place.",Christian

Often leaving weights where they use them, don't clean the machines after use and often sit for a long time looking at their phones. The gym is not staffed all the time and so no one tells these children to clean up after themselves.

Otherwise the gym is fine with modern and working machines. It can be a little cramped in some areas where the free weights are used, but this wouldn't be a problem if people were not so entitled and treated it like their personal gym.",Christian
372,Mike Martins,"The average age of the members in this gym must be somewhere around 17/18 at the most.

Strenght training has been compressed into too little space and instead they added a lot of useless cardio equipment for amateurs. It’s becoming more and more clear that the latter is the clientele which PureGyms wants to cater to - not us, who consistently go to the gym +5 times a week.

The air ventilation does not seem to work properly, though.",Christian
382,Gregor Haeusler,"One star just for the nice location. The service ended his shift 10mins early and completely ignored me and another costumer waiting on the counter. The machines are mostly so old, they must be from the 90s. Not recommendable.",Christian
383,RUECKENWIND,"I'm shocked after reading reviews that are just 3 years old (urban gym) compared to today. Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

The only good thing are the other people, most of them are friendly. The gym itself is just disgusting and not worth the money. That's just the review for that certain location.",Christian

392,P-A M.,"I've worked out in three different gyms in Copenhagen and this one was clearly the worst. There aren't enough showers in the men's locker rooms and they are incredibly wastefull in water. Another low point is the door system letting you in the gym, which keeps denying you the entrance if you're not perfectly positioned inside the cabin - too much fuss for nothing. Also, there are many annoying teenagers that aren't there for serious training, they're loud and using the equipment for fun while other people want to go on with their workout.

Otherwise the amenities for the workout per se are good and various.",Christian

Stuff is friendly, options of memberships are very limited. For example, you can't work out without starting a binding contract that states that when you stop the membership you'll have to pay the current + the next month.

At the end of the complicated way through the customer service, the result was: ""I understand you but sorry we cant do anything, you have to pay the money"". Yeah, this is sad to pay fee for months when you could have attended the gym but you were unaware.
That was by far my poorest experience of customer service in Denmark.",Christian
429,Yana Maksimova,"I train there. Not long ago they changed their machines which seem to be with less quality than the older ones.
If you want to train after work be aware that the place can be crowded. It is on convenient spot but due to that it can be also hard to finish your training on time.
It is clean and you can always clean the machines before and after usage.",Christian

431,Przemysław Bronowicki,Everything I need !!! Thx,Christian
432,Mia Wulff,"Overall good center with proportionally good amount of machines compared to popularity. However, there is no hip thrust bench and only high benches, which means I have to go to another center for that exercise. dB is somewhat heavier than the other centers and the jumps between each weight are incredibly large at 2-3 kg. per steps. Bathing facilities could be better located. Nice and clean center which appears clearly. Lots of water points.",Christian

435,Roshni Chakraborty,This is one of the best centrres of Fitness world in Aalborg on the basis of the size and equipments,Christian
436,G. S.,"This is from PureGym on Gugvej and Friis in Aalborg. They are some good and spacious centers with a lot of machines, so you don't feel like you are stalling during your training. On Gugvej there is good parking! Nice places.🤗",Christian
437,Mads Carlsen,"There are sometimes problems with groups of teenage boys who make noise, come in casual clothes, and are not there to train but to socialize and film videos for social media.

In addition, it is a center that is not too overcrowded, and has an OK amount of equipment for such a small center, and the surroundings are not too noisy as the premises are spread out.",Christian
438,Finn Thoft Jensen,"The training and the facilities are ok, but the last two times I've been there there has been a lack of toilet paper and/or paper towels in the men's changing room. The cleaning has not been ok either.",Christian

442,Oskar Korsgaard,"Super good service, but I think there are too few bench press racks and too few toilets, this may well cause a lot of waiting time, there could also be more water dispensers around, with this the prices also start to become too high, otherwise a fine training place.",Christian
443,Tobias Aarup,Too little space when it is busy and not enough machines. But otherwise I think there is a nice variety and the machines are in good condition,Christian
444,Christian Jensen,"Bad parking conditions. Had to stop at Lidl and when I got to the center the door was locked - Normally it's not a problem, but this center apparently requires a special chip in the card that can only be obtained during opening hours. This was not stated on the website!",Christian

447,Ivan Penchev,"Small and exclusive gym, One of the thing that pissed me most about it was that I wanted to use just the gym, which in all other gym from the Fitness world franchise cost 150 DKK, however this is not permitted and they require you to make a full membership for their gym and classes, even if you dont want to visit any of them, which is 250 DKK. As i said exclusive.",Christian

450,Afshin Loghmani M Toussi,"Very friendly staff.
It's one of the most expensive fitness world's centers in whole Denmark, but it's one of the most under equipped ones. You can find more equipment in lots of other cheaper centers and also the devices in this center already present in this one, either have less features or unadjusted, such as the treadmills, the scale and the rowing machines.",Christian

460,Vera K,"I really enjoy Fitness World on Jens Baggesens vej. They have the best choice of training classes in Aarhus to my knowledge. I live in Tilst, but the Fitness World there basically has no classes at all.. maybe a handful spread over the week and often mornings.
So it is definitely worth driving to this other Fitness World with lots of evening classes and friendly staff.

The only thing is that in summer it can get very hot inside and the air is thick. So the ventilation can't keep up with the amount of people training.",Christian
461,Mikołaj “Złączka” Chomacki,They say biggest gym in scandinavia. This place is really cool! People are lovely. Can bit crowded in aftetnoons,Christian
462,Mika Summanen,Amazing cardio classes with great atmosphere!,Christian
463,Thai Hiep Bui,"Quantity over quality, very over rated, expensive. Poor cleaning and poorly organized both from the customers and the employees. Dumbbells lying everywhere, weight bars every where on the floor, racks missing dumbbells for days is a normal thing. So many machines that are so close to each other it is impossible to move around without hitting something by accident. Not very friendly staff.",Christian

465,Lenka Švidrnochová,"Amazing gym with two floors, therefore enough space for everyone. Highly recommended for trainings in the heart of Aarhus.",Christian
466,suverenia,"Very expensive place considering that the sauna and steam bath never work properly. If the sauna is not down, then the steambath is down, and it takes months for them to fix. The steambath has currently been down for 2-3 months, and before the steambath broke down, the sauna was down for an equally long time. Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while. The bench is bent and unstable, and the walls of the sauna are getting ripped apart. And noone gives a damn.

This fitness chain took down fitnessdk and turned it into utter garbage.",Christian
467,John Muller,Excellent gym that's just recently been revamped. Has everything including full machine setups and free weights. Spacious and has a nice dressing room and sauna. Conveniently located right in the middle of town.,Christian
468,Jonas Elm,One of the best Fitness Worlds I have been in. It has a good selection of all the gear you need. Not too crowded in the morning and a major plus is that there is a sauna and a steam bath.,Christian

476,Anders Klüver,"Not as many good classes anymore. TRX and functional training classes are great for strength and cardio, but difficult to find a good class",Sanna
477,Emma H,"Great gym! So many good offers for memberships and lots of machines and equipment. The only negative thing I would say is that nobody is brining towels to have with them, which has usually been a requirement at gyms I go to. Therefore if people don't use the paper towels to clean you sometimes find a machine that is really sweaty and dirty and you have to clean it yourself! I think it would be nice if they changed that and asked people to bring towels for hygienic reasons. But otherwise I love the gym and would recommend! Really friendly staff too!",Sanna
478,Klaus Pedersen,"Great place to do your workout. New and always good maintained equipment, and their team activities are always with good instructors. Like most of the other Fitness World centers it's really good.",Sanna

481,bendix holtgraefe,"Great fitness studio with nice and helpfull staff. The only drawback is the very unflexible membership system. I'm working abroad every other month and there is no suitable membership plan for a situation like this.

482,Jakub Wieczorek,Clean but have some old equipment that could be replaced,Sanna

489,Dennis Au,Cluttered and strangely structured center. Disabled toilet and stretcher in the same room,Sanna
490,Maria,"Bad vibes! Too many people, especially at this FW is starring at you if you actually do a good job and are serious about training. To fit in, you should stare at your phone and don’t pay attention to exercise at all.. 🫤 It’s a shame.. The culture makes me change to FitnessX !!",Sanna
491,Antonin Fronc,"Clean gym with everything I need for general bodybuilding purposes. Although some equipment is visibly worn out and the gym may be crowded at times, it's not a reason to complain given the price and 05:00-24:00 opening times.",Sanna
492,Angel Del Fabbro,"Really Cheap fitness chain. Nothing luxury. Nothing to make the experience better. Dated cardio machines. Everything feel old. No improvements in 10 years in technology applied to training or experience. Quite dirty, low maintenance. Dirty change rooms, not even soap in showers. Weird people hanging out but not training. Unfortunately they are like a monopoly, not other options in the city. Danes have high income but the gyms are really lame and basic compared to other countries.",Sanna
493,Ben Brownlee,"A good part of the Fitness World chain of gyms. Not their biggest gym in Aarhus, but it is spacious and well laid out. There are areas for cardio, machines, circuit training, free weights and a well-placed number of squat racks. Two large rooms are available for group classes.

The recent refurb has given a well deserved refresh to the place. Staff were very attentive when we were coming out of the covid restrictions. They seem to have fallen back into old patterns since. But are generally friendly and are there to help out.

My second favourite Fitness World in Aarhus.",Sanna
494,Gabe Avenia,"Gym is decent, but there is no air-conditioning in the summer which makes it just unbearable. Also no WiFi and mediocre maintenance.",Sanna
495,Jonx,Overall a great spacious gym with many facilities,Sanna
496,Rekai Ewan Campbell,Great gym with a lot of the latest equipment. Can be a bit crowded at times but never to the point that you cant work around it. They offer tours of the place so ask for one and check the place out.,Sanna
497,Daniel Carlsson,Really nice gym with a lot of equipment! They have everything you need for a good training session. There can be a lot of people around 16-18.,Sanna

Equipment is new, clean and much nicer to use than FW - locker room is a little small",Sanna
500,Bardia Varasteh,"The staffs are super nice that is why I give this star for them.
But sorry that I cannot add any more stars since the center is super crowded! No matter when you go! Early morning! Evening! Week days weekends.... I think they should introduce some rule and dont accept new members since the center is too small for the people wanna to do workout! The last two times I had to just leave since I could not find any free spot to do workout!",Sanna

510,Ariana-Claudia Pop,"What I like to this gym is that the owner always buys something new ❤️ all members are polite, they don't stare, they don't yell or moan when they exercise and everything is clean. The culture of this place is different form any other brand gym in town, it is really friendly and you can exercise in peace. It is very well equipped, there is no exercise you can't do, and is not crowded. The price is under the market price! This gym should get more 5 stars reviews. I tried it for one month and then decided to become a regular 😊",Sanna
511,Marck Skov,"Be careful; it is impossible to cancel a subscription with Infitness. Half a year after cancellation, they still send bills, despite verbally confirming the cancellation of the subscription in person at the centre on Møllevangs Allé 142.",Sanna
512,Theodora Irava,"Totally disappointed!
I chose this gym because it was the cheapest from the town. Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.
When I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership. The staff is hardly speaking English.
I strongly recommend to avoid this gym.",Sanna
513,Derrick Derby,Registered just yesterday and they sending me a bill. Haven't received a card yet to train. Customer service is really not cool. Disappointed already,Sanna

520,Thai Hiep Bui,"Members do not clean after themselves, do not put the weight back
The gym is messy and dirty. The floor is nasty. The weights are everywhere but on the racks. The bottom floor that is in the cellar is humid as hell. Equipments are not maintained and a lot of them are broken or have flaws. The rubber bands that are available for use are so dirty and sticky. The only reason I keep the membership is because it is literally 2 minutes from where I live. Do not recommend to anyone, not worth the money.",Sanna

533,Ahmet E,Just love it,Sanna
534,Jesper Søkbæk,"Not the biggest Fitness World, you can safely say, there aren't many parking spaces. So you have to stop at Bilka if you come in prime time, i.e. around 16 to 18:00.

The place is open until 00:00 on weekdays, so that everyone can get a workout in. There isn't bikefit and all that cycling like in the really big centres.",Sanna
535,Martin Damgård Nielsen (Marhlder),"Great place for a casual workout. Not super clean and they are generally not very good at maintenance of their exercise machines, but most of their customers probably don't notice because they don't put on a lot of weight. I have been asking them multiple times to fix various things, but it seems everything that costs money comes at a slow place even though it seems they have plenty of customers.
Update: They think it's a good idea to turn off the lights and they no longer provide cloths for wiping the machines 👎
I think they have misunderstood the concept of inflation, raise the prices don't make the product worse...",Sanna

546,Rob Arias,"Ok, but it could be more thought out with, for example, a pull-up bar on which you can do muscle ups, as well as replace some of the immediate weird inclined bars with something that can be used.

The voice echo from the women's bathroom loud as it gets and everyone from the men's room can hear everything. Not sure if the management have notice it. In comparison from other SATS gym this place relatively small.  Great location fitness center and accessible to public transport few minutes walking distance to the central station and Tivoli gardens.",Veron
622,C L,5-star rating for the second floor lounge. I was running around the park 630am and needed a bathroom and a coffee. SATS is perfect for just that. I didn’t try the gym. Neither do I see the point of paying for cardio machine when you are so close to a beautiful park in summertime.,Veron
623,Guido Nap,"The gym is ok, although with rising prices I guess it became a bit expensive for what it offers. It is a bit small but very modern and fairly clean. At least more than other gyms I have seen in Copenhagen. It is often packed when it comes to using the barbell stations but definitely, I have seen it worse.

The staff is usually nice, although when you have a question (e.g. about billing etc.) it is all managed in a very confusing way. I do not think is their fault, but rather something related to their internal procedures and IT systems.

The classes are in Danish, but you can also find classes in English. Besides the language barriers, I find the classes useful and entertaining. Usually, the instructors are of a good level and there is quite a good variety.

The app is a welcome help for booking classes and other functions, although sometimes the user experience could be improved (and the same with the website).

I am still a client and I think the gym has the potential though to become even better. It depends on what the management will make out of it.",Veron
624,Eric H,"Small, but well equipped fitness center.

SATS have a bunch of different spots in Copenhagen and if you don't like the size, there are always others.

Personally, I feel like this is one of the better, if you just want to get in and do a workout and get out. You'll rarely wait for a spot anywhere.

They have everything you need including 6 squat racks / power cages and a bunch of free weight stuff, cardio machines. The only thing lacking is team workout.

The changing rooms are good and spacious.

Despite leaving the country and clearly cancelling my membership, this gym continued to charge me a recurring fee, month after month. I was shocked and frustrated to see this charge appearing on my credit card statement, especially as I was no longer in the country and had no access to their facilities.

The customer service provided by this gym was equally disappointing. I tried reaching out to them multiple times, via email, to rectify this issue but my requests were ignored or brushed off. It took a significant amount of time and effort on my part but they had no interest in resolving the issue.

In my opinion, this gym is clearly more concerned about lining their pockets rather than providing a quality service to their customers. Their lack of attention to customer service and unethical billing practices is unacceptable and I would not recommend this gym to anyone.

Sweaty as a river but on fire within

Multiple instances during class at 6am in the morning that the coach did not show up at all, without explanation or apology either. so we had to conduct the class on our own and still pay for membership.

677,Rune Perstrup,"An Unhygienic Coronavirus Petri Dish.

I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously.",Veron
678,Frank Ejby Poulsen,"The gym is great, spacious and has everything, and the personel is friendly and helpful.

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded.",Veron

681,Angi Las,"The Studio is not in best Shape. As Many before me wrote: it’s very small, the devices are packed!! Could be a lot cleaner - especially the toilets.
But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.

If any staff employee of FW is reading it, can you PLEASE contact the staff in this gym and asked them to when they leave at 8 PM maybe set some radio or some motivational music? There was this one day that the song got stuck it was play allllllllllll night long, the same one song, and it was not even a good one, and literally after 40 mins I left coz not even my headphones helped.

Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

P.s. a bit of politeness would be appreciated

Thank you,

706,Anna Maria Kyritsaki,"It is an okay gym, some of the equipment are not working (like some of the treadmills), it has a decent variety of machines, there is some (limited) space for free weights and it does *not* offer classes.

Stuff is friendly, options of memberships are very limited. For example, you can't work out without starting a binding contract that states that when you stop the membership you'll have to pay the current + the next month. That's pretty strange as in another branch I could just pay for a week of use without any strings attached.

Other than that, you can surely do your workout here but it doesn't compare to other more central/maybe more expensive gyms.",Veron
707,Christian Segg,"Small for all the machines they’ve put in there. Smell of sweat due to bad AC.
Friendly staff though, and clean facilities.
Can be very crowded during holidays and weekends.",Veron
708,P Gh,"Despite having good machines and lovely physical space, the staff and customer service is unappealing. If you dont speak Danish, it is probable to get overcharged by mistake because some of the staff are not well-trained with the system besides having language barrier. I paid fee for extra months while my membership was supposedly on pause. They sent me bills without even sending me a notification about reactivation beforehand. At the end of the complicated way through the customer service, the result was: ""I understand you but sorry we cant do anything, you have to pay the money"". Yeah, this is sad to pay fee for months when you could have attended the gym but you were unaware.
That was by far my poorest experience of customer service in Denmark.",Veron
709,Yana Maksimova,"I train there. Not long ago they changed their machines which seem to be with less quality than the older ones.
If you want to train after work be aware that the place can be crowded. It is on convenient spot but due to that it can be also hard to finish your training on time.
It is clean and you can always clean the machines before and after usage.",Veron
710,Ivan Hangstrup,"Always friendly staff. Cleaning is top notch. However, one could wish that men would fix their intimate shaving at home...
But nothing Fitness World can be held responsible for.",Veron
711,Hrvat,"A very nice place. Service helpful and nice. Plenty of exercise space, fitness room, nice locker room and shower. I recommend",Veron
712,William Løkke,Really nice training center with everything you need,Veron
713,Mads Carlsen,"There are sometimes problems with groups of teenage boys who make noise, come in casual clothes, and are not there to train but to socialize and film videos for social media.

In addition, it is a center that is not too overcrowded, and has an OK amount of equipment for such a small center, and the surroundings are not too noisy as the premises are spread out.",Veron
714,Tonni Jensen,The place if you want to train and be able to get to the machines. Still the place with good machines and space.,Veron
715,Chris Bateman,"Paid for a single session whilst on holiday. Was 49kr for a single or I think 100-109kr for a week.

Well equipped and big gym with friendly staff.",Veron
716,Afshin Loghmani M Toussi,"Very friendly staff.
It's one of the most expensive fitness world's centers in whole Denmark, but it's one of the most under equipped ones. You can find more equipment in lots of other cheaper centers and also the devices in this center already present in this one, either have less features or unadjusted, such as the treadmills, the scale and the rowing machines.",Veron
717,abhinav sekar,It's a fitness center. It's good.,Veron
718,Vera K,"I really enjoy Fitness World on Jens Baggesens vej. They have the best choice of training classes in Aarhus to my knowledge. I live in Tilst, but the Fitness World there basically has no classes at all.. maybe a handful spread over the week and often mornings.
So it is definitely worth driving to this other Fitness World with lots of evening classes and friendly staff.

The only thing is that in summer it can get very hot inside and the air is thick. So the ventilation can't keep up with the amount of people training.",Veron
719,suverenia,"Very expensive place considering that the sauna and steam bath never work properly. If the sauna is not down, then the steambath is down, and it takes months for them to fix. The steambath has currently been down for 2-3 months, and before the steambath broke down, the sauna was down for an equally long time. Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while. The bench is bent and unstable, and the walls of the sauna are getting ripped apart. And noone gives a damn.

This fitness chain took down fitnessdk and turned it into utter garbage.",Veron
720,Lora Alexandrova,"It is my gym and I love it. Just go before 8am or after 7pm, otherwise it is super busy and you may have to even queue for machines",Veron
721,Ben Brownlee,"A good part of the Fitness World chain of gyms. Not their biggest gym in Aarhus, but it is spacious and well laid out. There are areas for cardio, machines, circuit training, free weights and a well-placed number of squat racks. Two large rooms are available for group classes.

The recent refurb has given a well deserved refresh to the place. Staff were very attentive when we were coming out of the covid restrictions. They seem to have fallen back into old patterns since. But are generally friendly and are there to help out.

My second favourite Fitness World in Aarhus.",Veron
722,Bardia Varasteh,"The staffs are super nice that is why I give this star for them.
But sorry that I cannot add any more stars since the center is super crowded! No matter when you go! Early morning! Evening! Week days weekends.... I think they should introduce some rule and dont accept new members since the center is too small for the people wanna to do workout! The last two times I had to just leave since I could not find any free spot to do workout!",Veron
723,H,"Great gym, best I've tried in Aarhus for the price.
Equipment is new, clean and much nicer to use than FW - locker room is a little small",Veron
724,Theodora Irava,"Totally disappointed!
I chose this gym because it was the cheapest from the town. Unfortunately, the services provided are really poor. The smell in the gym is awful, they do not have any ventilation at all, when you want to breath some fresh air, you have to open the window. There are also problems with the hygiene in the bathroom.
When I wanted to terminate my membership I had a lot of problems. I blocked my automate payment at the end of the month. In the first days of the next month I received a letter to announce me that they couldn't take money directly (they charged 160 dkk for the letter and because I blocked the automative payment). Afterwards they asked to pay for the current month even if I didn't go there anymore( I assumed that stopping to pay was enough-maybe this was partly my fault). When I arrived there they asked me to pay one more month if I want to terminate my membership. I ended up paying 450 dkk for nothing. Another problem is that you have to go personally there if you want to terminate the membership. The staff is hardly speaking English.
I strongly recommend to avoid this gym.",Veron
725,Martin Damgård Nielsen (Marhlder),"Great place for a casual workout. Not super clean and they are generally not very good at maintenance of their exercise machines, but most of their customers probably don't notice because they don't put on a lot of weight. I have been asking them multiple times to fix various things, but it seems everything that costs money comes at a slow place even though it seems they have plenty of customers.
Update: They think it's a good idea to turn off the lights and they no longer provide cloths for wiping the machines 👎
I think they have misunderstood the concept of inflation, raise the prices don't make the product worse...",Veron
726,Jette Mikkelsen,"Nice place to train. Appreciate 2 floors.
Always friendly staff who guide in the best way",Veron
