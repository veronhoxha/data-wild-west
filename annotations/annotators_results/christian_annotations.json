Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.\n\nWhile the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines\/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)\nThe mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.\n\nAll in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.","annotator":"all"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-11-06T19:55:29.608834Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T21:53:26.411479Z","inner_id":129,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":130,"annotations":[{"id":130,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"taxonomy":[["Negative"],["Negative","Hygiene"]]},"id":"jqSCTwTtli","from_name":"taxonomy","to_name":"text","type":"taxonomy","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-11-06T21:53:35.076683Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T21:53:35.076683Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":8.207,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"69d6bf21-4f43-4b24-b7d5-a274d4c8d065","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":130,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"8413a258-Christian.csv","drafts":[{"id":75,"user":"chmh@itu.dk","created_username":"chmh@itu.dk, 1","created_ago":"14 hours, 57 minutes","result":[{"value":{"taxonomy":[["Negative"],["Negative","Hygiene"]]},"id":"jqSCTwTtli","from_name":"taxonomy","to_name":"text","type":"taxonomy","origin":"manual"}],"lead_time":8.196,"was_postponed":false,"import_id":null,"created_at":"2023-11-06T21:53:35.000917Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T21:53:35.000917Z","task":130,"annotation":null}],"predictions":[],"data":{"ID":406,"text":"Messy, unorganized and strange gym culture.
