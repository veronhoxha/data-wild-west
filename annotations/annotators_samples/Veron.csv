But time and again I get annoyed that there is no possibility to cook some water for coffee and there are no staff available when you call them in their opening hours. Then they're always ""meetings."" That's enough for me to think about signing up! Hope it gets to the right person, so it becomes a constructive input instead of sour upbringing.

Furthermore, the manager said that there is no sound on the surveillance but that I have threatened one of the members The right version is that I was pushed and threatened by a member who is clearly on steroids in PureGym. He was pushing me away and threatened me violently. The police came and questioned us both. The police closed the case (for 3 days ago 23/10/23 and did not want to look at the monitoring and assessed that he was not allowed to use both machines at the same time.

Later I get an email with a warning because of my inappropriate advice and then find out that one of the two women was a director. I don't get the opportunity to defend myself and tell my side and try to send a complaint to the member service, but also gets rejected and get a short answer to keep the warning.

However, there are some things that could be improved, including faster repair times of defective machines. 2-3 weeks is not all right, but unfortunately often a reality. Besides, you rarely see receptionists more, as these have apparently been given other tasks such as cleaning and cleaning up. I have also seen people go straight into my regular centre several times, without checking in, so unfortunately I also suspect cheating due to the often lack of reception staff. On the wish list is a SATS center in Hillerød:-) Otherwise I am perfectly satisfied with the 2 centres (BLOX and ABC) which I use primarily",all

I've quit my subscription down there because I don't feel it't worth the money, it would have been cheaper, such about half price then I might have kept my subscription.",Veron
100,"I am incredibly satisfied with SATS! The staff always seems polite and welcoming, the center is clean and neat, and there is a good culture among users to respect 'public space'. The sauna is amazing, and the changing is always nice and clean. There are many different kinds of teams, and the team trainers seem extremely competent and present. My only criticism, however, goes on the waiting lists for the teams, often there are over 30 people on the waiting list for popular teams for several weeks out in the future, and it makes it difficult to plan your training. Especially when you are at the top of the waiting list an existing day and have to stay'ready' for if you get space. I am aware that it is not SATS' 'guilty', although it is just great that their team is so popular, but it is unfortunately rather impractical and small annoying for us, who just really want to grow a lot of Gravity.But everything in everything I am extremely satisfied!",Veron

I have trained on the team with functional training for more than 5 years - the director is great. Now the team is closed with the reason that there are not enough participants on the team. No, there are no waiting lists on the team, debt offers quality and social cohesion. That's exactly what the smaller centres can offer, but it's obviously not a factor in SATS unfortunately.",all

In addition, I have a roommate who uses the center considerably more often, who has the same experience) There is a lack of general management of the center, otherwise it wouldn't be so bad... There is a lack of consistent hand alcohol in half of dispensations. - All toilets are grossly disgusting. It looks like no toilets are checked more than 2-3 times a day, which is absurd when you think of the amount of people who use the center daily. Staff should go a round every hour in peak hours, but move rarely from the counter, even when there are more at work. In addition, the toilets smell like a lack of basic cleaning (other than emptying the trash can and cleaning mirror) - no water vending machines, which means that you are forced into disgusting toilets to fill your small water bottle. - Several cabinets in the men's dressing room do not work, which means that it can be difficult to find a closet in any way.",all

If you sign up after 14th of the month, you must add payment methods to the center so that they can use the chosen method for the coming month. I was told in the center that I should just have done it before the next 14.Your payment department by phone is fairly cold and indifferent to their centers providing incorrect information upon registration.

249,"Bondovej gym has been my regular and favorite gym for the last 2 years. Primarily because, in my opinion, it is the best pure gym center in this part of Odense🙃

equipment :
there is a lot of different equipment to choose from and it mainly consists of technogym plateloaded and machines as well as cable towers and there is a good mix of new and old, which appeals to me as I am a fan and often like the old equipment best. There is a sea of ​​grips and handles for the back and the same for the tricep and bicep. The only thing missing is a good seated cable row 🤫

Atmosphere/premises:
The center itself is divided into 3 large rooms with lots of space and high ceilings, it gives a nice spacious feeling even when there are many people. The division is great and is set up in a very logical context. The people are super nice and nice and there is really a feeling here that there is room for everyone! 🥰

Service:
The employees are just the nicest people and there is always time and energy for a hello or a little chat 🫠they are good at receiving rice and praise and listening to us users, so a huge pat on the back from here and keep having one of the best gyms in Odense😉",all
251,"This gym offers all items, equipment and facilities that you would need. There are two big weightlifting areas (including barbells, dumbbells and machines), a big cardio area (treadmills, crosstrainer, stepper, cycles, ...), an area with the usual workout machines, a TRX area and in the one weightlifting area you have some open space to do your own workout (there are spinning ropes, medicine balls, kettleballs, asults, ringes, etc.). Moreover there are two course rooms (1 for spinning, 1 for everything else). They offer a decent amount of fitness classes (the only thing I am missing is Body Combat). And I really like the 'freestyle' courses like Crossfit and Functional, because they include different equipments and are usually with only a few people so the trainer can focus on you. Everything is very clean, including the shower facilities. There is also a sauna and a steam bath. The ladies changing room comes with big mirrors, hair dryers and hair straightener. It's usually not to crowded and in my opinion super cheap (99 DKK for students).",all
257,"An Unhygienic Coronavirus Petri Dish.

I have been working out in several Fitness world centers around Copenhagen, and when it comes to basic matters of hygiene, this center is the worst. I have visited the center a couple of times so what I describe here is not an outlier.

There is an extreme limited number cleaning liquid dispensers - usually 1 or 2 per large room

Nobody cleans their equipment after use. Nor does the staff encourage basic hygienic behavior.

I have not at any point seen any employees go about doing their cleaning routine.

I find this lack of responsibility astounding since we are in the middle of a hotspot in the middle of a pandemic. I have visited other fitness world centers that do take their responsibility seriously.",Veron
260,"The gym is great, spacious and has everything, and the personel is friendly and helpful.

However, the gym members are often not aware at all of gym etiquette: sharing gym equipment, respecting common spaces to allow other users to access the equipment, or even being just nice and polite. It's happened to me that I asked a user if I could borrow the dumbbells for a quick set after he finished a set, to which he reacted angrily saying that they were his and I had to wait for him to be done. When expressing my surprise and thinking he was rude, he chased me to ask me angrily what he did wrong, he's using them, they're his, what's wrong with that? I tried to explain that I only needed them for one set as he was done with his, while he was resting, since there were no other available. To which he replied that I could go to the other end of the gym to get the same ones, and he does not see why he has to share them with me since he is using them. I trained with other weights, and after I finished my 3 sets, he was still not done with the weights. So, I could have waited a long time for him to be done. That's just one example among many others. Very often people train right in front of the dumbbells rack, admiring themselves in the mirror, hence occupying the whole area in front of the rack and not allowing anyone to pick dumbbells. Once I tried to explain, and just received an angry answer that he moved away so there was space, why am I making a problem? He didn't see any problem. But at this stage, I think it's just a problem of education and behaviour in common spaces, more than a lack of knowledge about gym etiquette.

Moreover, many users do not even respect the gym's clearly specified rules at all: no training with your bag in the gym, no outdoor shoes for training, using disposable shoe covers when entering the gym, or cleaning the equipment after use. Obviously, training during peak hours is a nightmare, and it is best to train when it is less crowded.",Veron

267,"The Studio is not in best Shape. As Many before me wrote: it’s very small, the devices are packed!! Could be a lot cleaner - especially the toilets.
But what bothered me most is the very little amount of training devices: Not a big selection to choose from and therefore missed a lot of my usual training equipment.
The biggest critique point for me is the age of the devices: they are all old, especially the Steppers on the second floor are A NIGHTMARE. Everything could be a lot more modern.
Also big critique: the staff literally has no idea about nothing. You get different info everywhere, they don’t know anything about the contracts or what info you need to sign up for a membership. Also found all of them to have a certain „annoyed“ attitude.
I am really truly disappointed in the Studio especially because from outside it gave such a nice impression.
Will go to another fitness world studio in the future and hope that the next one will be more modern and clean und the staff maybe a little more educated.",Veron

All are kept well maintained and on a leash if necessary. According to rumors, there are also classes for different things but I don't know anything about that.

298,"I give 1 star more than #fitnessworld actually deserves for the great ""hold"" instructors. Otherwise it is a poor service fitness center that want to rip you off at every turn. I got a special offer when I signed up because it was FW birthday - ""All-in"" free for one month. It was the end of month and I did not get to use it at all. But to my big astonishment, it was an opt-in subscription service, so I was actually billed for the next month without even being notified beforehand! I cancelled it right away but I had to pay for that month anyway. So I used it a few times. And here comes the next surprise - again I was billed for the product I ""bought"" on top of my monthly fee.
I am asking, is that what a reputable fitness chain do? I doubt..",Veron

307,"Yet another Fitness World center, which have been worsened by the PureGym-makeover.
Strenght training has been compressed into too little space and instead they added a lot of useless cardio equipment for amateurs. It’s becoming more and more clear that the latter is the clientele which PureGyms wants to cater to - not us, who consistently go to the gym +5 times a week.
It’s such a pity with this systematic destruction of the relatively few good gyms we have.",Veron
314,"This place is great!
They have all you need and they're open 24 hours, if it was even a bit dirty it's because lazy members do not know how to behave! People working there are trainers and office staff they are not your slave and they are not there to clean you mess! But there is one thing that drives me crazy and I was trying to ignore it but it is a bit hard now... the music when the staff leaves. If any staff employee of FW is reading it, can you PLEASE contact the staff in this gym and asked them to when they leave at 8 PM maybe set some radio or some motivational music? There was this one day that the song got stuck it was play allllllllllll night long, the same one song, and it was not even a good one, and literally after 40 mins I left coz not even my headphones helped. And yesterday there was some country music. In general after 8 there is always ""not the best music"" and I think if it's like this I'd prefer to work out in silence.
But otherwise as I mentioned great place.",Veron
316,"A lot of young people go to this gym, and don't appreciate or follow gym etiquette. Often leaving weights where they use them, don't clean the machines after use and often sit for a long time looking at their phones. The gym is not staffed all the time and so no one tells these children to clean up after themselves.

Otherwise the gym is fine with modern and working machines. It can be a little cramped in some areas where the free weights are used, but this wouldn't be a problem if people were not so entitled and treated it like their personal gym.",Veron
317,"The average age of the members in this gym must be somewhere around 17/18 at the most. Its pretty close to a folkeskole, hence you'll find alot of kids and teenagers in this gym.They come in large groups and take all the space (in an already very small gym) by basically playing around, acting like they're at a playground.

Other than that, the gym is very dirty and messy (This is also due to most of these teenagers neither sanitizing/cleaning up after themselves) and the music is too loud as well as being very poorly choiced songs.",Veron
323,"I'm shocked after reading reviews that are just 3 years old (urban gym) compared to today. Looks like it was a nice location some time ago. Since the last years the gym changed 3 times the owner. Now it's puregym and it's just disgusting. Staff (if someone is there, after 6 no one is working) is unfriendly and lazy, not motivated to help you at all. No introduction when I started there, no refund  after problems with the snack vending machines.

While heavy rain you can enjoy a shower from the roof. It's dirty as hell, everything sticks and it's disgusting to touch. And that's for all areas. Feels like the changing room is cleaned ones a week or less.

Most of the cardio machines are not working properly and cleaned max one time a day. It took 6 weeks to fix 3 bikes and 2 cross trainers. But still all of them have miss functions with the computer. To get the heart rate is a lottery and the rest of the numbers is also not working correctly. There is not even one digital clock in that gym, so smartphone or smartwatch is a must if numbers and timing is important.

If you want to take a class, good luck. There are just 2 offers at 3 dates in the week. But you pay for it.

I don't get why this location is one of the most expensive ones and I need to pay extra to train there. It's just scam and the worst gym I joined in the last 20 years.

So if you just move some irons and have lot's of experience it's totally fine to train with that old rubbish. With less experience and focus on different things you are totally lost.

The only good thing are the other people, most of them are friendly. The gym itself is just disgusting and not worth the money. That's just the review for that certain location.",Veron
328,"Terrible.

They changes my membership 2 times without me telling to do so.
First time i has to pay a supplement of 100 dkk because a mistake of one of the brilliant guys working there.

Second time they set my main gym elsewhere, so today i had to pay 30dkk extra to go to the gym i usually go.

On top of that, the first mess they did was not fixed. It is impressive how Fitness World hire the brightest minds in Denmark.",Veron
333,"I've worked out in three different gyms in Copenhagen and this one was clearly the worst. There aren't enough showers in the men's locker rooms and they are incredibly wastefull in water. Another low point is the door system letting you in the gym, which keeps denying you the entrance if you're not perfectly positioned inside the cabin - too much fuss for nothing. Also, there are many annoying teenagers that aren't there for serious training, they're loud and using the equipment for fun while other people want to go on with their workout.

Otherwise the amenities for the workout per se are good and various.",Veron

351,"It is an okay gym, some of the equipment are not working (like some of the treadmills), it has a decent variety of machines, there is some (limited) space for free weights and it does *not* offer classes.

Stuff is friendly, options of memberships are very limited. For example, you can't work out without starting a binding contract that states that when you stop the membership you'll have to pay the current + the next month. That's pretty strange as in another branch I could just pay for a week of use without any strings attached.

Other than that, you can surely do your workout here but it doesn't compare to other more central/maybe more expensive gyms.",Veron
361,"In Copenhagen for 6 nights and my hotel had a terrible gym, so I searched for a nearby gym and found SATS. I found this gym to be great! It has just enough equipment to get in a good workout. I never had to wait for anything. The team was also super helpful with getting me day passes.",Veron

The men's shower room has only five compartment room compared to the old ones which have around eight. There is a sauna too. The voice echo from the women's bathroom loud as it gets and everyone from the men's room can hear everything. Not sure if the management have notice it. In comparison from other SATS gym this place relatively small.  Great location fitness center and accessible to public transport few minutes walking distance to the central station and Tivoli gardens.",Veron
363,5-star rating for the second floor lounge. I was running around the park 630am and needed a bathroom and a coffee. SATS is perfect for just that. I didn’t try the gym. Neither do I see the point of paying for cardio machine when you are so close to a beautiful park in summertime.,Veron
366,"Probably, my favorite SATS in Copenhagen. You can enjoy the harbor view while you train. I would only like a couple of things to be improved: the ventilation in the treadmills area and the sauna. I think it’s a shame that the sauna is in such a bad condition if you compare to Copenhagen’s municipal swimming pools. But probably it’s customers fault, who put all kinds of liquids on the oven, which they are asked not to do.",Veron
368,"The view is amazing. I am satisfied with the changing room cleanliness (although I usually go out of rush hour). The staff is also nice.
But where am I supposed to train? There is this small area for floor workouts where 2 people (max) fit, if doing jumping jacks, burpees or similar. No place to combine jumping, weights and floor exercises. You should also put a few pairs of small barbels upstairs, so I don't need to go to another universe to fetch pair of 3kg weights. It is also super hot inside, which is weird since it is below 0 degrees these days in Copenhagen. I was told that summer is unbearable. Air conditioning and a set of small weights on the second floor would be appreciated. thx :)",Veron

No need to mention it is overly expensive, and that they don’t offer membership options (the only one being Mon-Fri until 3pm VS anytime, for 40kr difference). Furthermore, they brand it as Spa when there is only one small sauna which just reopened after several weeks, and is now missing features such as time and sensor. Unacceptable.",all

398,"While it is spacious and with the ability to brag about a wide variety of equipment, the standard of several machines, is low. Many of the treadmills are particularly noisy (moreso than one would normally expect) due to lack of maintenance, same with the exercise bikes. Lack of maintenance is one of the major characteristics of this center. Things are more than often quite worn, or parts might be missing from certain equipment.

While the staff is friendly, they don't, in my experience, care much about upholding the rules of the center. At this point, after 1,5 years of attending this SATS, it seems the the patrons can behave however they wish. People lob around their backpacks and dufflebags in the training area, they go barefoot and may talk on the phone loudly (normally I'd be completely fine, but the noise level is consistently high, even if I wear headphones blasting loud music). Along with this, hardly anyone puts the weight plates back where they belong and even fewer wipe down the machines/equipment after use (The older crowd is good at cleaning up after themselves though, kudos)
The mens changing room is usually not that pleasant an experience, the patrons like to cough and blow out their snot and phlegm  into the only sink in the dressing room, providing the rest of the patrons with even more unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it smells like someone is cooking in there. I'm yet to find the source of it, but it's an odd smell for a changing room.

All in all, the center could, by providing the patrons with proper, sanitary and pleasant exercise conditions, flourish much more than it is now. I believe it would take a good effort from the again, friendly staff, by making sure that rules are followed by the patrons.",all

There is a lot of snuff and wool from socks in the bathroom that needs to be cleaned - and no one mops the floor (neither staff nor users). The sauna and steam bath (closed) are clammy after a whole day of sweat. People use their own rules regarding the sauna, e.g. having an unofficial party with music in the sauna, so that others cannot enter without stinking of peppermint. The training area is also pretty minimal, e.g. no Precor machines or the like. Ventilation is almost always switched off (certainly to save electricity), which means that the air is heavy in changing rooms - especially in bathrooms, water drives down the walls and windows. The air is generally bad in the training area - and in addition there is often a smell of cigarette smoke and car exhaust, which comes down from the parking garage due to drafts (the glass doors are typically completely open). There is also a lot missing compared to previously under Fitnessdk, for example. free coffee. The quality is just decreasing and the clientele is going in the wrong direction: more suspicious types in the evening (and it's not the ones from Gentofte).

Conveniently, now that the steambath has been down for ages, they restricted the opening hours of the sauna to just a few hours a day, and it is practically closed in the weekends. Sauna and bathing area are usually dirty and unhygienic and often smell of urine. There is a lot of mold in the sauna, which they scrape off once in a while.
